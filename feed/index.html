<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This article is going to be a very brief 
rundown of what React.js is and how to use it with your application. 
React is a very popular JavaScript library and there are a lot of 
courses out there that can teach you its ins and outs in detail. 
However, if you just want to get up and running and figure out the 
details later when you need to, then this article with go through just 
that. We will cover how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects in 
our database using React and AJAX to interact with our Rails API. </p>



<p>React
 is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create a website&#8217;s UI
 by using small pieces of code (JavaScript files called Components). You
 can use these components to display dynamic data (eg: data from your 
api or database) as well as static elements (regular HTML elements like 
&lt;p&gt; or even &lt;script&gt; snippets for regular JavaScript). This 
allows for a cleaner and more maintainable way to build your front-end 
compared to writing massive custom JavaScript and HTML files. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>For more information on this topic, you can find a similar tutorial here: <a href="https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/</a></p>



<p>This
 tutorial is based on the above article, however, they seem to be using 
an older version of React so some of the functions might not work 
anymore. If you followed that tutorial and created the React components 
with React.createClass, then you might run into some JavaScript errors 
in your browser console such as </p>



<p>TypeError: React.createClass is not a function</p>



<p>This
 is because React.createClass is no longer used for creating components.
 This article will aim to make this work using React 16.2, Rails 5.2 and
 the latest version of JavaScript at this time (2018). </p>



<h2>React</h2>



<p>In
 our setup article, we ran rails g react:install to setup React to work 
with Rails. Now we can focus on creating the components. React&#8217;s 
components are stored in the /apps/assets/javascripts/components/ 
folder. We can start by creating a new folder here called book inside of
 this components folder, then create a new file here called 
book_app.js.jsx. Your folder stucture should now be as such: 
/apps/assets/javascripts/components/book/book_app.js.jsx. </p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s populate this book_app component with code so that it looks like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c</a></p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c.js"></script>



<p>If
 you are curious, you can find out more about React functions at their 
website here: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html. However, if
 you just want the cliff notes of what is relevant in this project, I 
will explain it here. </p>



<p>You declare a React component with the line: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class BookApp extends React.Component { 
...
} 
</pre>



<p>Inside this class, there are certain default functions that 
React will load in a set order. The functions are called: constructor(),
 static getDerivedStateFromPropers(), render(), and componentDidMount().
 So everytime you load a React component on a page, these functions will
 be called in that order. The constructor() initiates the component and 
the render() function renders the HTML for the page. Then if that state 
of the component changes, the render() function gets called again. </p>



<p>Here is the general flow of what is happening here in our component: </p>



<p>The
 constructor initiates the component in our BookApp by setting the state
 with an empty array of &#8220;books&#8221;. The &#8220;state&#8221; in this case can be thought
 of as the place to store variables so that our page can use it and 
render dynamic content. Then it renders text that says &#8220;Loading&#8230;&#8221; for a
 bit before calling componentDidMount(), which runs a custom function we
 created called getDataFromApi(). This function then uses AJAX 
(basically JavaScript that can interact with our API) to get Book data 
from our database and store it in the &#8220;state&#8221;. Now that the state has 
changed again, render is called and updates the &#8220;Loading&#8230;&#8221; to &#8220;Your 
books will go here!&#8221;. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>The getDataFromApi()
 function stores variables called error and isLoaded in the state, and 
sets their values depending on how the API called goes. This helps with 
troubleshooting because the render() function will print out errors if 
it does run into any. </p>



<p>Now that we have the component, 
lets go into /app/views/homepage/index.html.erb and change it so that it
 renders our component instead of the default text. Replace everything 
in the index.html.erb file with: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;%= react_component 'BookApp' %&gt;
</pre>



<p>This tells the application to render the React component we just created. You can start your server again and refresh the page to see it. Your page should now look like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books.png" alt="" class="wp-image-921" srcset="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books.png 955w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books-300x63.png 300w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books-768x161.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></figure>



<p>Now
 we can work on populating this area with a table to render all our book
 entries. Fortunately, React allows you to render other components 
within a component so that we don&#8217;t have to stack one file with so much 
code. So let&#8217;s start by creating some new files called book_table.js.jsx
 and book.js.jsx in the same folder as book_app.js.jsx. Fill out the 
table file so that it looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/fe72fac20278203c3ece7263536a741e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/fe72fac20278203c3ece7263536a741e</a> and the book file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/266b22788e8a7f6144c026abffbc9441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/266b22788e8a7f6144c026abffbc9441</a></p>



<p>If all went well, then you page should now look something like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-1024x459.png" alt="" class="wp-image-922" srcset="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-1024x459.png 1024w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-300x135.png 300w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-768x344.png 768w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table.png 1055w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now you should have a working delete button that should delete the entries when clicked! You can then implement the rest of the functions as you would like to build on this application. For some examples on implementing adding and editing with React, this article seems to cover the rest: <a href="https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/">https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/</a></p>



<p>For our purposes, this basic application should be enough to deploy to a Production environment. The next articles will go through some common options for hosting your web application. <br></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this
 article, we will create two roles for the users: the Admin role and 
Normal_User role. Users with the Admin role should have access to create
 and modify books on the website, while normal_users should only be able
 to view the books. </p>



<p>We use the Rolify and CanCanCan gems to help us implement authorization. To start this, go into the console and type: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g rolify Role User
rails generate cancan:ability
rake db:migrate
</pre>



<h2>Roles</h2>



<p>Then go into /app/models/Roles.rb and make sure that it looks like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243</a><br><br></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243.js"></script>



<p>Now we can go into our /db/seeds.rb file and add some roles, books, and sample users. </p>



<p><p>The seeds.rb file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9.js"></script></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s erase our database and start fresh by typing: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
</pre>



<p>We can then run the commands in the seeds.rb file by going into our terminal and typing: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake db:seed
</pre>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>The seeds.rb file are 
just a list of database related actions that you want to perform to fill
 up the database with default items. This way you don&#8217;t have to go into 
the Rails console or database to manually enter values each time you 
want to reset your database. In this seeds file, we created 2 roles, 2 
users, and made a loop that created 5 sample book entries. </p>



<p>You
 can check to see if these values were entered into the database 
successfuly by running the following command to open your database: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sqlitebrowser db/development.sqlite3
</pre>



<p>To browse a table, right click on it and click on 
Browse Table. The books table should have 5 entries, Roles should have 
2, Users 2, and User_Roles. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>The
 &#8216;roles&#8217; table should include the roles that we created, admin and 
normal_user. Each of these should be associated with an id such as 1 and
 2. Each user in the &#8216;users&#8217; table should also have an id associated 
with it. The &#8216;user_roles&#8217; table should have a column called user_id and 
role_id. This is the table that lets the application know which users 
(their ids) are associated with which roles (their ids). In this case, 
it should say that User with an id of 1 (the admin user we created) 
should have the role with an id of 1 (the admin role).</p>



<p>Now
 we can begin to implement authorization by permitting certain actions. 
Lets start by going into the /app/models/user.rb file and add some role 
checking functions: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">def admin?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has_role?(:admin)
end

def normal_user?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has_role?(:normal_user)
end
</pre>



<p>The user.rb file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f.js"></script>



<p>These
 functions allow use to check if a user has a certain role. We can use 
this in the /app/models/ability.rb file which helps use define what each
 user can do on the site. Open up the ability.rb file and edit it so 
that it looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14.js"></script>



<p>In
 this case, we will allow users to view and create new books, admins can
 manage (create, delete, edit, read) everything, and unauthenticated 
users will only be able to read. For more information on defining 
abilities, please visit: <a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Defining-Abilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Defining-Abilities</a></p>



<p>Now
 we just have to go into our /app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb 
file to make sure our controller is checking for permissions before 
allowing any actions to be performed. At the top (under class 
BooksController and above the index method), add the following: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">load_and_authorize_resource
before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:index]
</pre>



<p>The controller should now look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>The
 before_action line will direct users to the login screen if they try to
 access any method in the books controller except for :index. You can 
test this out by logging out and browsing to localhost:3000/api/books to
 see the list of books (this URL is the :index function). Now try to 
visit localhost:3000/api/books/1 (the :show function) and it should 
redirect you to the login page. Once you login, you should be able to 
see the particular book with 1 as the id. </p>



<p>After this, let&#8217;s open up /app/controllers/application_controller.rb and add these lines into the class: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
&nbsp;redirect_to root_url
end
</pre>



<p>This will redirect the user to the home page when 
they try to do something that their user role is not permitted to do. 
Now we have a basic authorization process for the website!</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>Right
 now we can test out the read/get functions like :index and :show, but 
we haven&#8217;t went over the ways of put and post options (creating, 
deleting, or editing). We will implement these functions in the next 
article where we implement React for the front-end of the website. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>A more detailed article on this topic can be found here: <a href="https://www.nopio.com/blog/authentication-authorization-rails/">https://www.nopio.com/blog/authentication-authorization-rails/</a><br></p>



<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the previous article, then we should now have a basic API for retrieving information about our Books. Since our website now has some purpose, we should add some authentication functions so that users can sign up and log into the site. This can help us track users and implement authorization later on.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s generate some components needed for this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails generate devise:install</pre>



<p>Generate the views for the authentication pages:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g devise:views</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Devise is the gem (plugin/library for rails) that has a bunch of pre-built functions we can use to implement authentication.</p>



<h2>Users</h2>



<p>We can now run the follow to generate the User model for our database:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails generate devise User<br>
rake db:migrate</pre>



<p>You should now have a basic login screen for the website! To check, restart your rails server and visit http://localhost:3000/users/sign_in</p>



<p>Click on Sign up and create a user</p>



<p>After you create the user, you should be automatically signed in. Or you can sign in through /users/sign_in (if you are already signed in, it will just take you to the home page). Now we just need a way to let users know that they are signed in.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s add a navigation bar at the top of the page for User related options like signing in and signing out. Go to /app/views/layous/ and open up your application&#8217;s layout file: application.html.erb. Then change the contents so that it looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/d2bb86ad1b3e50f28bf4a14b4f344c3b">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/d2bb86ad1b3e50f28bf4a14b4f344c3b</a></p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/d2bb86ad1b3e50f28bf4a14b4f344c3b.js"></script>



<p>Now, we can add some CSS to style the page just a bit. Open up /app/assets/stylesheets/ and rename the application.css to application.scss. Then edit the contents in there to include bootstrap and add some styling: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/e9087f054ee8fb773f0180caeb75ab5c">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/e9087f054ee8fb773f0180caeb75ab5c</a></p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/e9087f054ee8fb773f0180caeb75ab5c.js"></script>



<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>



<p>The @import bootstrap line lets us use a very popular css library. More information on Bootstrap here: http://getbootstrap.com/</p>



<p>It essentially has a bunch of prebuild styles that we can use to make a website so that we don&#8217;t have to style it from scratch.</p>



<p>When you start the server and look at the website, you should now see a navigation bar at the home with a Dropdown menu for Users at the top right. Right now, clicking it won&#8217;t do anything, because we have not added the appropriate JavaScript to handle this action. In this case, we can use Bootstrap&#8217;s JavaScript library to help us handle dropdown menues.</p>



<p>Go to /app/assets/javascripts/application.js and add //= require bootstrap-sprockets to the very bottom of the page and save. Now when you click on the User button at the top right, you should be able to see the menu drop down and show actions such as Login and Logout. These buttons should work already since the Devise gem has taken care of the authentication functions for us, but since we want users to know when they are logged in, we will make some changes to this menu.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s make it so that you will only see the Login button if you are not already signed in. Similarly, the Logout button should only appear if the user is already signed in. To do this, let&#8217;s open up the /app/views/layouts/application.html.erb file again and make some changes to the user menu section (around lined 32):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;% if user_signed_in? %&gt;<br>   &lt;%= link_to "Edit profile", edit_user_registration_path %&gt;<br>&lt;% else %&gt;<br>   &lt;%= link_to "Sign up", new_user_registration_path %&gt;<br>   &lt;%= link_to "Login", new_user_session_path %&gt;<br>&lt;% end %&gt;<br>&lt;% if user_signed_in? %&gt;<br>   &lt;%= link_to "Logout", destroy_user_session_path, method: :delete %&gt;<br>&lt;% end %&gt;</pre>



<p>Your application.html.erb file should now look something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3a87440097d5de9e16ef40c704270528">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3a87440097d5de9e16ef40c704270528</a></p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3a87440097d5de9e16ef40c704270528.js"></script>



<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>



<p>In Ruby on Rails, the .html part of the file name shows it is an HTML file, and the erb extension at the end let&#8217;s the server know that this can accept Ruby code as well. The parts in between the angle bracket/percentage signs (&lt;% some_code %&gt;) are to indicate Ruby code, which is usually programming logic that HTML files would otherwise not be able to use. The brackets without &#8216;=&#8217; signs like &lt;% some_code %&gt; are indicators of Ruby code that do not need to render anything, while the &#8216;=&#8217; signs like &lt;%= some_code %&gt; indicates that something should be rendered. In this case, we can see that the &#8220;if else&#8221; logic of checking a user&#8217;s authentication does not need rendering, while the actual links to the Login/Logout functions need rendering, since they are actual buttons on the page.</p>



The code that says something like link_to and new_user_session_path are just pre-built functions to make it more convenient (it also looks more readable, since it spells out exactly what it does). The Login line of code &lt;%= link_to &#8220;Login&#8221;, new_user_session_path %&gt; is essentially just <a href="/users/sign_in">Login</a> and you can try replacing this just to see for yourself.



<p>When you login now, you should be able to see the Logout button, and the Sign in button would no longer be there. This allows users to see if they are logged in or out. Now if you ever want content that only users who are logged in should see, you know to just wrap it with these one of these lines: 
&lt;% if user_signed_in? %&gt;
   
Yay, you are logged in!&lt;% end %&gt;
</p>



<p>This is how the login page should look like now:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://localhost/wp-content/uploads/image.png" alt="" class="wp-image-872" srcset="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image.png 1014w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-300x130.png 300w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1014px) 100vw, 1014px" /></figure>



<p>In the next article, we will go through Authorization, which means giving different users certain roles (such as Admin or Client) and allowing each of these roles to see different content. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Now that we have the environment setup, we can finally start building our API for the web application. This article will go through how to create a basic REST API for perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. </p>



<h2>Start</h2>



<p>Lets start by creating the home page. Generate files needed for the home page by typing:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g controller home_page index
</pre>



<p>Create the resources for an object called book.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g resource book title author:text description:text pages:integer published:date
</pre>



<p>Migrate the database</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake db:migrate
</pre>



<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>



<p>If this is the first 
time you are seeing the above commands, here is what it is doing in a 
nutshell for our purposes. &#8216;g&#8217; is short for generate, so in the commands
 above we are telling rails to generate things such as a controller or 
resource. The index part is just the page itself (index.html) where you 
can write HTML in and the controller allows for this page to interact 
with the server (to get information from the database). Generating the 
resource in this case allows us to add the routes (or URL paths) for 
getting information about the book. This book is then set represented by
 a title, author (in text format), description, number of pages (in 
integer format), and when it was published (in date format).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s add the routes for the api we are making. In the config/routes.rb file, add the lines:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">root 'home_page#index'
namespace :api do
&nbsp;resources :books
end
</pre>



<p>The routes.rb file should look like this:&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/82f7a0dca262749e14ebbd28e3b8bbaf" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/82f7a0dca262749e14ebbd28e3b8bbaf</a><br><br></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/82f7a0dca262749e14ebbd28e3b8bbaf.js"></script>



<p>Now let&#8217;s replace the contents in the books controller in /app/controllers/books_controller.rb to be:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">module Api
&nbsp;class EventsController &lt; ApplicationController
&nbsp;&nbsp;def index
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;render json: Book.all
&nbsp;&nbsp;end
&nbsp;end
end
</pre>



<p>Now go into /app/controllers and create an folder 
called api, then move the books_controller under there. New path should 
be /app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb</p>



<p>Any API related controllers should now go in that folder.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Putting
 books under the :api namespace and api folder allows you to access the 
resource in the URL after /api. So in this case, it would be <a href="http://website.com/api/books" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website.com/api/books</a>.
 Making books a resource by writing &#8220;resources :book&#8221; allows users to 
access books through its RESTful URLs. Below are the following URLs you 
will be able to use to get data about the books. Since we have the index
 method in the controller and views for books, you should be able to 
visit that page (we haven&#8217;t added any book records in the database yet, 
so these URLs wouldn&#8217;t return anything right now).&nbsp;</p>



<p>GET		/api/books(.:format)			api/books#index</p>



<p>POST	/api/books(.:format)			api/books#create</p>



<p>GET 	/api/books/new(.:format)		api/books#new</p>



<p>GET 	/api/books/:id/edit(.:format) 	api/books#edit</p>



<p>GET 	/api/books/:id(.:format) 		api/books#show</p>



<p>PATCH 	/api/books/:id(.:format) 		api/books#update</p>



<p>PUT 	/api/books/:id(.:format) 		api/books#update</p>



<p>DELETE 	/api/books/:id(.:format)</p>



<p>More information on REST here: <a href="https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restfulresourcenaming.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/restfulresourcenaming.html</a></p>



<p>Here are the basics that you need to know in Rails regarding these APIs and routes:&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211; Controllers will have a few standard methods:&nbsp;</p>



<p>	index method for showing all the books (/books)</p>



<p>	create method for creating a new book (/books/new)</p>



<p>	show method for showing one particular book (/books/id where id is the book&#8217;s id in the database)</p>



<p>	update method for updating an existing book (/books/id/edit)</p>



<p>	destroy method for deleting an existing book (/books/id/ but with a DELETE method)</p>



<p>Here
 we will fill out the rest of the controller methods to allow for the 
above behavior through the API. Change your books controller so that it 
is:&nbsp;<a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/bd76031fe933b833beffd29e9af538dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/bd76031fe933b833beffd29e9af538dc</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/bd76031fe933b833beffd29e9af538dc.js"></script>



<h2>Adding Books</h2>



<p>Now let&#8217;s add some Books to our database so that we can test out the API. Go into the Rails console by typing in the terminal:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails c
</pre>



<p>(Make sure you are in the project&#8217;s folder)</p>



<p>The
 Rails console lets you run Ruby code in. real time to make changes to 
your application. In this case, we want to add a new Book, so let&#8217;s type
 in:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">b = Book.create :title =&gt; "How To Cook", :author =&gt; "Bob", :description =&gt; "Teaches you how to cook. ", :pages =&gt; 20, :published =&gt; "2018-11-03"
b2 = Book.create :title =&gt; "How To Bake", :author =&gt; "Bill", :description =&gt; "Teaches you how to bake. ", :pages =&gt; 15, :published =&gt; "2018-02-03"
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>While in the console, type &#8220;quit&#8221; to exit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This
 will create 2 entries in our database in the Books table. The database 
right now is stored in /db/development.sqlite3. You can open this with 
sqlitebrowser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t downloaded it yet, you can install it by running these commands in the terminal:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxgndu/sqlitebrowser-testing
sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install sqlitebrowser
</pre>



<p>Then you can go into your project folder and open it with the sqlitebrowser command:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sqlitebrowser db/development.sqlite3
</pre>



<p>You can right click the Books option and see your 
entries in there. Now you can try out the API urls above to see it in 
action (Make sure you start your server first by running: rails s). For 
example, go to localhost:3000/api/books/1</p>



<p>You should 
receive a page with information about one of the books we just created 
in JSON format. The &#8220;1&#8221; at the end of the URL represent&#8217;s the ID, which 
is found in the ID column of the Books table in the database. So if you 
go to localhost:3000/api/books/2 then it will give you information on 
the other book. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this series of tutorials, we will go through how to build a Rails application with  authentication/authorization. We will briefly go over what each function does and set up a bare-bones application template to use with React.js.This particular article will focus on just setting up the environment so that we can start the project. </p>



<p>To  make sure you are on the same page, you can start on a brand new virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04. You can download virtual machines  from here:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.vmware.com/ca.html</a> for VMware (free for Windows) or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a> for VirtualBox (free for MacOS and Windows).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubuntu Desktop operating system can be download here: <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.ubuntu.com/download</a> or if 18.04 is not the latest version anymore, you can also check here: <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/</a></p>



<h2>Start</h2>



<p>To start, we will install the dependencies needed to install Ruby on Rails:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open
 up the terminal by pressing ctrl + alt + T and type in the following to
 start installing (make sure you wait for each command to finish before 
running the next):&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Install Git for version control</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install git
</pre>



<h3>Install libraries and other dependencies</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
</pre>



<h3>Installs RVM for managing Ruby environments</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>If at any point the 
terminal says you have not installed or function is not found when you 
have just installed the program succesfully, an easy workaround is just 
close the terminal and open it again. You can also type source ~/.bashrc
 or source ~/.bash_profile to see if it works. If it still doesn&#8217;t work,
 make sure the program was properly installed and there were no error 
messages in the logs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Continue setting up ruby environment</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rbenv install 2.5.1
rbenv global 2.5.1
echo "gem: --no-document" &gt; ~/.gemrc
gem install rails -v 5.2.0
rbenv rehash
</pre>



<h3>Install NodeJS (JavaScript Runtime environment)</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd /tmp
\curl -sSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodejs.sh
cat /tmp/nodejs.sh | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
</pre>



<h3>Cleanup</h3>



<p>Almost done the setup, let&#8217;s do some cleaning up and updating just to be sure</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ~/.rbenv
git pull
cd ~
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
sudo apt update
</pre>



<p>Now we should be ready to begin creating the app.</p>



<h2>Creating The App</h2>



<p>Create the application</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails new rails_template
cd rails_template
</pre>



<p>Make sure you have installed a text editor so that we can edit some files For Sublime text install, do:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text
</pre>



<p>For Vim install, do:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install vim
</pre>



<p>Then open up the Gemfile edit it to include the 
proper gems. In particular, we are going to need Devise for 
authentication and CanCanCan for authorization. Authentication would 
mean the parts responsible for logging in a user, whereas authorization 
would be permissions for which types of users (roles) are allowed to do 
certain actions. These are usually very important for people to define 
in projects, since you wouldn&#8217;t want a guest to be able to access Admin 
level functions (such as deleting users).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Gemfile should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If
 you are unfamiliar with gems, you can think of them as additional 
programs, plugins/extensions, or libraries that the application can use.
 </p>



<p>We also need to remove Turbo Links since it can cause  issues with some of the other technologies we are going to use later  on. Remove the &#8220;//= require turbolinks&#8221; line from  app/assets/javascripts/application.js. Remove the two  &#8220;data-turbolinks-track&#8221; =&gt; true hash key/value pairs from your  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. </p>



<p>
The application.html.erb file  should look like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292﻿</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The
 application.html.erb file here determines how your pages should look. 
In general, all your pages in this application will use the HTML here 
for its layout, and the &lt;%= yield %&gt; tag is the part that changes 
depending on the page. </p>



<p>After this, let&#8217;s run the following to install our database</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt install sqlite3
</pre>



<p>We will change to using Postgres database later</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Sqlite
 is a lightweight database good for development, but not that great at 
handling a lot of connections. So we will use Postgresql later on when 
we move it into production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have saved the new Gemfile, run the following command inside the application&#8217;s directory to install the gems:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">bundle install
</pre>



<p>Let&#8217;s generate the files for React so we can use them later on:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g react:install
</pre>



<p>After everything has been installs, run the 
following to start the server, then visit localhost:3000 to see if the 
application started successfully.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails s
</pre>



<p>If all is successful so far, it should say Yay! you&#8217;re on Rails!</p>



<p>To stop the application server from running, press <strong>CTRL+ C</strong> at the terminal to stop the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that the application is up and running, we can start making a basic API.</p>

<h2>Encrypting</h2>



<p>Encrypting
 is the process of turning data into something that is not 
understandable. Decrypting is the process of turning this jumbled 
information back into something readable. This is useful for hiding 
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and contact 
information. You can encrypt information in databases so that only 
authorized people will know how to decrypt it and view the information. </p>



<p>You
 can also encrypt data that is being transported through a network (such
 as submitting payment information through an ecommerce website). On 
websites, data being transferred to the server is encrypted if you see 
https insteald of http in the URL. We will go over this and how to 
encrypt your website like this later on in the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When information is encrypted, there is usually a key that only authorized people know of that can decrypt this information. Two main types of encrypting information are Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric Encryption. </p>



<h3>Symmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In this method, the information being encrypted is encrypted and decrypted with the same key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A very simplified illustration of encryption is below</p>



<p><strong>Message</strong>: </p>



<p>  I like apples</p>



<p><strong>Encryption Algorithm: </strong></p>



<p>Makes every letter increase by 1</p>



<p><strong>Encrypted Message: </strong></p>



<p>  j mjlf bqqmft</p>



<p>Send encrypted message</p>



<p>Receive encrypted message</p>



<p>Decrypt by moving every letter back by 1 to get message.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Asymmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p> In this method, there are two keys involved, 1 for encrypting the information (public key) and one for decrypting the information (private key). </p>



<p>A friendly introduction to asymmetric encryption can be found here: <br><a href="https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e">https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e</a><br></p>



<h2>Hashing</h2>



<p>Hashing
 also turns information into something not understandable. However, the 
algorithms are designed so that it is supposed to be impossible to 
decrypt back into something meaningful. This is a good way to hide 
information if there is need to decrypt the information. For example, 
some media sharing websites may have URLs that look like <a href="http://www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj</a>.
 That text at the end could be a hashed version of a very long title. In
 this case, visiting the URL with jumbled up text will lead to the 
correct video, so there is no need to decrypt it into something 
meaningful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption should be used when you have a need to 
read the original information. For example, sending emails with 
confidential information. People will need to be able to read this 
information, so a way to decrypt the message is necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hashing
 is more secure and should be used if it is not necessary to decrypt the
 information. For example, passwords usually do not need to be 
decrypted. When you create an account for most websites, the password 
you enter does not get stored in the database. The password is hashed, 
and then the resulting hash is stored in the database. So when you 
login, it is comparing the hashed value of what you entered with what is
 stored in the database. This is why &#8220;Forgot my password&#8221; functions do 
not send you your password, because they do not actually keep the 
password in a readable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The main points in this article are:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Encryption
 prevents unauthorized people from seeing information, and can be 
decrypted by authorized people to view the information.&nbsp;</li><li>Hashing messes up information so that it cannot be decrypted into anything meaningful. </li></ul>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Web
 servers help your web application serve information to clients. You can
 run an application with Rails with just its default application server,
 but it will likely not do too well in a production environment with 
lots of users trying to use the application at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Servers</h2>



<p>There
 are three main web servers used for web applications today: Apache HTTP
 Server, Nginx, and IIS. Setting up servers like Nginx can also allow 
you to scale better when your application gets more users. For example, 
it can act as a load balancer that helps distribute traffic to different
 servers when one server becomes too overloaded with work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brief note on scaling:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There
 are two main types of scaling, scaling vertically and scaling 
horizontally. Scaling vertically in this context means adding more power
 to your machines (for example, more ram, cpu cores, etc). Scaling 
horizontally means adding more machine to help distribute the load. 
Scaling vertically can be very expensive at a certain point and may not 
yield as much performance/dollar when compared to horizontal scaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 servers can also help with configuring things such as SSL (the 
certificate that secures your website and gives it the HTTPS instead of 
HTTP in the URL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article outlines in more detail on the difference between servers:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/">https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/</a></p>


<p>I
 would also recommend reading more about load balancer and reverse 
proxies since these topics come up pretty often when configuring 
production environments. You likely will not need to know about these 
when starting off, but it is good to know that they exist:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/</a></p>


<p>We will go over how to use Nginx with Ruby On Rails in the other articles so that you know how to monitor your application. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways of storing and retrieving data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 applications typically use databases to manage their data. There are 2 
main types of databases: SQL based databases and NoSQL databases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SQL Databases</h2>



<p>SQL
 databases are relational databses. This means that an entry in a row 
can be related to another entry somewhere else in the database. For 
example, if you have a database that stores Books and Authors such as 
below:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Books</strong></p>



<p>_______________________<br>|___Id_|__Title___|_Author_|<br>|___0__|Aligators_|__Bob__|<br>|___1__|Squirrels_|__Joe__|<br>|___2__|Pumpkins|__Bob__|<br>|___3__|Eggplants|__Susie_|<br></p>



<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>



<p>_______________________<br>|__Id__|__Name__|_Age___|<br>|___0__|___Bob__|___23__|<br>|___1__|___Joe__|___27__|<br>|___2__|_Susie__|___29__|<br></p>



<p>Books
 with Ids 0 and 2 can be enforced to belong to the Author with an Id of 
0. SQL databases enforce this relationship so that if there is a 
conflict with these relationships, then it will let you know (in more 
cases, it won&#8217;t let oyu make the change or it will throw and error).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about SQL, this is a good interactive site for starting out:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">https://sqlbolt.com/</a></p>


<p>Examples of SQL relational databases: Postgresql, MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Databases can have tables. Tables can have Rows and Columns for storing information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211;
 SQL itself stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language that 
is used to query databases to retrieve and store information.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>



<p>NoSQL
 databases can also be queries with SQL. However, these databases do not
 enforce the relationships between the entries. So in theory, SQL 
dabases would be more stable, since it has these rules to keep the 
object relationships in check. However, having these rules enforced 
means more overhead in performance, so NoSQL databases will be faster in
 some areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more details on SQL vs NoSQL differences, see this article:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool">https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool</a></p>


<p>Examples of NoSQL databases: <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Couchbase</strong></p>



<h2>JSON</h2>



<p>JSON
 is another way to manage data. It is a data structure stored in text 
format that a lot of languages/tools are able to interpret. In web 
development, this is usually used to communicate data between servers. 
When requesting information from a server, the server can go into the 
data base to retrieve the data, then return the results to the requester
 in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A JSON object looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>{title: &#8220;Aligators&#8221;, Author: &#8220;Bob&#8221;};</p>



<p>For more information on JSON, refer to this article:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This
 article will go through some helpful tools that are used in web 
development. The tools/software in this section are what we will be 
using in this tutorial. </p>



<h3>Command Line</h3>



<p>We
 will be using the operating system Ubuntu 18.04 to create the project. 
You can open up the command line by pressing ctrl + alt + t. This is 
where you issue commands to the computer to do things. You can search 
online for interactive linux tutorials to learn more about using the 
command line. </p>



<h3>Virtual Machines</h3>



<p>Virtual
 machines can help you run the different operating systems if you do not
 want to buy a new machine or reformat your computer. It is also good to
 test out server related functions in an isolated environment later on 
in the tutorial. If something happens to go wrong and it breaks, your 
actual machine should still be fine and you can just create another 
virtual machine to start over. </p>



<p>These two virtual machines below are ones that I have used to develop on: </p>



<p>VMware: Pretty straightforward to use and the free version includes all the basic functions needed to start web development. </p>



<p>VirtualBox:
 The free version has the ability to create snapshots/backups of the 
state of the machine, incase anything were to go wrong. </p>



<h3>Browser developer tools</h3>



<p>For Chrome, you can access this by pressing F12 or going into &#8230; &gt; More Tools &gt; Developer Tools</p>



<p>The
 tabs you will likely use the most for troubleshooting will be Console 
and Network. The console tab shows errors or important messages when the
 page is loaded. You can also run JavaScript on it to interact with the 
page. The network tab can also show some errors and check responses from
 the server. </p>



<h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and text editors</h3>



<p>IDEs
 can help check the syntax for programming languages. They can also 
auto-complete certain keywords and generate commonly used functions. 
Most IDEs out there are very powerful and can help speed up the 
development process by a lot. However, in this tutorial we will be using
 normal text editors to build the program. Being too reliant on IDEs for
 checking errors or auto-generating code might build some bad habbits, 
so I tend to use text editors where possible. They are usually more 
light-weight so you can start programming on any old machine pretty 
fast. It&#8217;s also helpful to know how to use editors like Vim when editing
 on a server without a graphic interface. </p>



<p>Here are 
some good text editors to use (there are a lot of them out there, but 
these are the one&#8217;s I have used and liked so far): </p>



<p>&#8211; Sublime Text</p>



<p>&#8211; Atom</p>



<p>&#8211; Vim</p>



<p>&#8211; Nano</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Vim and Nano are text editors used in the command line. You can install it by typing in the terminal</p>



<p>sudo apt install vim</p>



<p>Then open up a new file by typing</p>



<p>vim yourfile.txt</p>



<p>Once
 you are in text editing mode, press esc, then a to start inserting 
words. If you want to quit without saving, press esc then type :q! and 
press enter. If you want to exit and save, press esc then type :wq</p>



<p>If
 you get trapped in Vim and can&#8217;t figure out how to exit, you can 
restart your machine and start with using Nano instead. The commands are
 right on the screen so it&#8217;s more straightforward for beginners. </p>



<h3>Version Control: Git</h3>



<p>You can install Git by typing in sudo apt install git</p>



<p>Git
 is a tool that helps keep track of changes you make to your code. It 
essentially helps you save drafts of your code, so that if you mess up, 
you can revert back to an old working version of the code. Before 
learning about Git, I used to copy my entire source code folder to make a
 backup, and name it something like code_backup_20180910 to keep track 
of the different version of my program. This can take a while and get 
pretty messy. With Git, whenever you get to a checkpoint in the project 
where you are happy with saving (maybe you finished a feature), you can 
just type git add . then git commit -m &#8220;Enter here a short description 
of the draft or changes that you made&#8221; then git push</p>



<p>Those three 
commands above will be the majority of commands that you will use in the
 beginning. After that, you will eventually learn how to put code into 
different branches and organize your progress/features for team 
development. I will leave it up to you to Google what each of those 
commands actually do. </p>



<p>Other useful tools that you may want to look into: </p>



<p>Fiddler is similar to the Network tab for the browser developer tools, but can show things in more detail. </p>



<p>Postman helps test out RESTful functions. More on RESTful topics later. </p>



<p>Jing is a great free program for capturing screenshots. Screenshots can help a lot when clarifying things over the internet. </p>



<p>PGAdmin
 can help view Postgresql databases in a graphical interface. Most 
databases have a program that can help view things in a GUI. </p>



<p>You
 may not need the below tools for personal development, but most tech 
companies nowadays seem to use these so it is good to know they exist so
 you can read up on them: </p>



<p><strong>JIRA and Redmine </strong>&#8211;
 Helps keep track of tasks, bugs, and improvement requests. People can 
easily log bug reports or see what they need to do for the day. (Redmine
 is open source and free). </p>



<p><strong>Splunk </strong>&#8211; Indexes your
 data and provides search utilities for it. When indexing log files, it 
can help troubleshoot server issues. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>Jenkins and Travis C</strong>I
 &#8211; For continuous integration. Essentially makes sure your application 
passes its tests whenever someone pushes a changes. (Travis CI is free, 
Jenkins is free, but need your own server). </p>



<p><strong>Codecov </strong>&#8211; Helps keep track of how much of the code is covered by tests. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>BitBucket</strong> &#8211; Version control like Git, but allows for free private repositories. (Free)</p>

<p>Testing is an important part of programming that ensures code quality and makes life easier in the long run. </p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p>If
 you are a complete beginner and have next to zero programming 
knowledge, then this section might not make as much sense. It should 
make more sense after making a few small projects and understanding how 
coding works in general. We won&#8217;t actually go deep into testing in these
 series of articles, so you can skim through it if you want, but this is
 definitely an important topic to know about somewhere down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In
 this article, we will briefly discuss the importance of testing code. 
When writing code, it is good practice to write tests for the code as 
well. This way, if you make any changes to the application in the 
future, you can run the tests to see if they still work as intended 
without having to manually test every function again to see if they were
 affected. We will go through a few testing topics below just to get an 
understanding of it. </p>



<h2><strong>Unit Tests</strong></h2>



<p>Unit tests are essentially pieces of code that test other code. For example, if we have the below function in Java:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int x = 1;

int addYToX(int y)&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;return x + y;
}
</pre>



<p>A test for this function could look like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(3, result);
}
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; You can ignore the 
&#8220;public void&#8221; part for now if you are not familiar with it. The main 
point of the first function is to take a variable &#8216;y&#8217; and add it to x, 
which has an initial value of 1. The test below then tests it by giving 
the addYtoX a value of 2. The &#8220;assertEquals&#8221; function then checks to 
verify if adding 2 to x that the function will return 3.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Driven development (TDD)</strong></h3>



<p>This
 is a style of development that is very popular for companies today. TDD
 means that you are writing your tests first before writing the code. 
This makes it more likely for developers to cover more of their code 
with tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, writing tests can also help a person 
write better code. This is because, writing testable code usually 
involves breaking a function down into smaller/testable pieces, which 
prevents functions from getting too convoluted. Making functions 
simpler, more readable, and shorter is usually a good way to prevent 
headaches in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, writing tests also help 
you think about covering edge cases and how the functions should handle 
unexpected input. This can make the code more robust and less likely to 
error out with unusual inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3>



<p>Behaviour
 Driven Development just is a way to write or implement the tests. In 
the above example, we tested whether adding 2 to x will equal 3 if x 
starts at 1. This may work if x is always expect to be 1, but if x 
starts at 2, then we would have to rewrite the test to to check if 
adding 2 to x equals 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent the need of rewriting 
this, we can test the behaviour the function instead of hard-coding 
things in. In this case, the behaviour of the function &#8220;addYToX&#8221; is to 
add the variable y to the variable x, so we can specify that in the test
 instead:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(x + y, result);
}
</pre>



<p>This way instead of changing and specifying the 
expected result each time, the test is saying that the expected result 
should be x + y.&nbsp;</p>

 programming languages have a unit testing framework to help you get 
started with implementing tests for the project. You can learn more
