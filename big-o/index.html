<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the Ruby on Rails tutorials on this website, then you should have a basic working application with an API to create, read, update, or delete items from your database. Following these concepts, you can build a lot of different applications, since this is essentially what almost every web application does. For example, a website that allows you to see movie ratings and reviews (such as IMDB) follows the same concept: </p>



<ul><li>Has a database of objects, in this case it stores movies. </li><li>The movies have columns such as name, year, rating or summary. </li><li>There is something that pulls this information from the database and renders it for the public to see. </li></ul><p>Even
 things like Twitter or Airbnb build on these same concepts (they are 
definitely more complicated than this, but the point is that they are 
all just applications that interact with a database and render things to
 users). So if you just build upon this template application, you can 
make a lot of different inventions. However, when the projects get 
really big (maybe you end up storing a million books in the database), 
then the application will naturally take longer to process this. In 
these cases, you will want to make sure that your code is as optimal as 
you can make it so that the application can keep running fast and scale 
better with time. For example, if you are implementing a search 
function, you don&rsquo;t want the code to go through a simple For Loop and 
loop through the millions of books before finding the resulting book. </p>



<p>The
 next few articles will also go through important concepts such as data 
structures and algorithms to help get a clearer picture of what 
efficient code looks like. However, it would be beneficial to first 
understand what Big O is to know how to evaluate the efficiency of code.
 This article will introduce you to some of the main points of the Big O
 notation so that you will have a basic understanding of what it is 
about. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Big O is a mathematical 
representation that describes how much time and space an algorithm 
requires as the input grows. We are going to go over 4 different run 
times that are most commonly seen: O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), and O(1). If 
you are afraid of math and feel like this makes no sense already, don&rsquo;t 
worry. I will go over this in plain English and will give simple 
examples to illustrate what each of these mean. This also means that the
 explanations in this article will be very basic and will definitely not
 go into as much detail as an academic textbook would, so if you are 
interested in this area then I would recommend taking a longer course on
 this since it is a very significant area in computer science. That 
being said, I do believe that even having a basic understanding of this 
is very valuable and will help you improve the way you code. </p>



<h3>O(n)</h3>



<p>When
 people refer to something as having a run time of O(n), it means that 
it will take as long as the size of &ldquo;n&rdquo; (the variable). For example, the
 below code would be considered to have O(n) run time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n times. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>If you recall from the <a href="http://docs.mediocreinventions.com/article?name=Programming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Programming</a>
 article, the for loop will run as long as the condition of &ldquo;i &lt; n&rdquo; 
is true. This means that this function will run 5 times if the value of 
&ldquo;n&rdquo; is 5, and 5000 times if the value of &ldquo;n&rdquo; is 5000. This has a 
&ldquo;linear&rdquo; run time because the size of &ldquo;n&rdquo; is proportionate to how many 
times it will run at a 1:1 ratio. So in the Search function example 
above, if the function loops through a million Book entries in 
alphabetical order, users will have to wait for the function to run a 
million times before it reaches the end. In the best case (&ldquo;maybe the 
book being searched starts with &ldquo;A&rdquo;), it might only have to loop through
 a handful of times before returning the result. Similarly, in the worst
 case scenario (maybe a Book&rsquo;s name is &ldquo;ZZZZZZ&rdquo;), then it will run the 
whole million times before returning the result. Although this can be 
very fast if the book&rsquo;s name started with &ldquo;A&rdquo;, Big O generally refers to
 the worst case scenario as its run time. So a simple for loop in this 
case would be O(n). </p>



<h3>O(n^2)</h3>



<p>This is O(n) to the power of 2, which means it runs exponentially slower than O(n). The code below would be considered O(n^2): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	for (j =0; j &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n * n times. ");	<br>	}<br>}</pre>



<p>You can see that there is a for loop nested within a for loop, 
and both of them depend on the size of &ldquo;n&rdquo;. Which means that if n is 10,
 then both the &ldquo;j&rdquo; and &ldquo;i&rdquo; loops have to run 10 times each. Since the 
&ldquo;j&rdquo; loop is nested within the &ldquo;i&rdquo; loop, the &ldquo;j&rdquo; loop has to run 10 times
 before the &ldquo;i&rdquo; value increments by 1. To finish, &ldquo;i&rdquo; will also need to 
run 10 times, which means 10 times 10. The point here is that both loops
 depend on the same variable and one of the loops is nested in the 
other. This makes it take exponentially longer to run as the size of n 
increases. </p>



<h3>O(log n)</h3>



<p>This one might be a bit 
more complicated to understand in terms of the code. However, the 
concept is much easier to understand. Algorithms that have a O(log n) or
 logarithmic run time are often regarded as very efficient and scalable.
 The code below is regarded as O(log n): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function divideByTwo(n) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>   if (n == 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else if (n &gt; 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var previousNumber = divideByTwo(n / 2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</pre>



<p>We haven&rsquo;t went through &ldquo;recursion&rdquo; so the above code might 
look a bit confusing (recursion is essentially a function that calls 
itself). The code takes the input &ldquo;n&rdquo;, prints out the number, then 
divide it by 2, and print out that number, then divide by 2 and so on 
until the resulting number is less than 1. You can see that this is 
scalable because even if the input is a million, if you keep dividing it
 by 2, the number of times this function has to run is still less than 
30. The number of times this function has to run only increases by 1 
every time &ldquo;n&rdquo; doubles in size. </p>



<p>We implement these kind of 
functions in real life all the time. For example, when you open up a 
dictionary and want to find a word, you only need to flip through the 
dictionary a few times before you find your word even though it may have
 thousands of pages. If the word is &ldquo;happy&rdquo;, you might start by opening 
the dictionary from the middle. If you reach the &ldquo;m&rdquo; section, you 
automatically flip back (maybe halfway). If this next section starts 
with &ldquo;e&rdquo;, then you flip forward again and repeat until you reach the &ldquo;h&rdquo;
 section to find your word. No matter how big the dictionary is, it is 
always a doable task because you are able to halve your results with 
each flip. This is much more efficient than flipping through each page 
one at a time, similar to what a for loop would do. </p>



<h3>O(1)</h3>



<p>This
 one just means constant time. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on any input size, the 
amount of time it runs is always going to be the same. A function like 
below would be considered constant time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function doBunchOfThings() {<br>	console.log("Do something. ");<br>	console.log("Do another thing. ");<br>	console.log("Do even more things. ");<br>	console.log("Keep doing things. ");<br>	console.log("Just do one more thing. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>No matter how many console.log() functions is fit in there, it 
is always going to be O(1) run time because there is no variable input. </p>



<p>There
 are a lot more notations out there and definitely more to analyzing run
 times, however, these are the essential concepts that should give you a
 decent understanding of how to determine the run time of a function. </p>
