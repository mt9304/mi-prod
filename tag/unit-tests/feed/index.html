<p>Testing is an important part of programming that ensures code quality and makes life easier in the long run. </p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p>If
 you are a complete beginner and have next to zero programming 
knowledge, then this section might not make as much sense. It should 
make more sense after making a few small projects and understanding how 
coding works in general. We won&#8217;t actually go deep into testing in these
 series of articles, so you can skim through it if you want, but this is
 definitely an important topic to know about somewhere down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In
 this article, we will briefly discuss the importance of testing code. 
When writing code, it is good practice to write tests for the code as 
well. This way, if you make any changes to the application in the 
future, you can run the tests to see if they still work as intended 
without having to manually test every function again to see if they were
 affected. We will go through a few testing topics below just to get an 
understanding of it. </p>



<h2><strong>Unit Tests</strong></h2>



<p>Unit tests are essentially pieces of code that test other code. For example, if we have the below function in Java:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int x = 1;

int addYToX(int y)&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;return x + y;
}
</pre>



<p>A test for this function could look like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(3, result);
}
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; You can ignore the 
&#8220;public void&#8221; part for now if you are not familiar with it. The main 
point of the first function is to take a variable &#8216;y&#8217; and add it to x, 
which has an initial value of 1. The test below then tests it by giving 
the addYtoX a value of 2. The &#8220;assertEquals&#8221; function then checks to 
verify if adding 2 to x that the function will return 3.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Driven development (TDD)</strong></h3>



<p>This
 is a style of development that is very popular for companies today. TDD
 means that you are writing your tests first before writing the code. 
This makes it more likely for developers to cover more of their code 
with tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, writing tests can also help a person 
write better code. This is because, writing testable code usually 
involves breaking a function down into smaller/testable pieces, which 
prevents functions from getting too convoluted. Making functions 
simpler, more readable, and shorter is usually a good way to prevent 
headaches in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, writing tests also help 
you think about covering edge cases and how the functions should handle 
unexpected input. This can make the code more robust and less likely to 
error out with unusual inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3>



<p>Behaviour
 Driven Development just is a way to write or implement the tests. In 
the above example, we tested whether adding 2 to x will equal 3 if x 
starts at 1. This may work if x is always expect to be 1, but if x 
starts at 2, then we would have to rewrite the test to to check if 
adding 2 to x equals 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent the need of rewriting 
this, we can test the behaviour the function instead of hard-coding 
things in. In this case, the behaviour of the function &#8220;addYToX&#8221; is to 
add the variable y to the variable x, so we can specify that in the test
 instead:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(x + y, result);
}
</pre>



<p>This way instead of changing and specifying the 
expected result each time, the test is saying that the expected result 
should be x + y.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most
 programming languages have a unit testing framework to help you get 
started with implementing tests for the project. You can learn more
