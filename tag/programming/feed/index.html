<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the Ruby on Rails tutorials on this website, then you should have a basic working application with an API to create, read, update, or delete items from your database. Following these concepts, you can build a lot of different applications, since this is essentially what almost every web application does. For example, a website that allows you to see movie ratings and reviews (such as IMDB) follows the same concept: </p>



<ul><li>Has a database of objects, in this case it stores movies. </li><li>The movies have columns such as name, year, rating or summary. </li><li>There is something that pulls this information from the database and renders it for the public to see. </li></ul>



<p>Even
 things like Twitter or Airbnb build on these same concepts (they are 
definitely more complicated than this, but the point is that they are 
all just applications that interact with a database and render things to
 users). So if you just build upon this template application, you can 
make a lot of different inventions. However, when the projects get 
really big (maybe you end up storing a million books in the database), 
then the application will naturally take longer to process this. In 
these cases, you will want to make sure that your code is as optimal as 
you can make it so that the application can keep running fast and scale 
better with time. For example, if you are implementing a search 
function, you don&#8217;t want the code to go through a simple For Loop and 
loop through the millions of books before finding the resulting book. </p>



<p>The
 next few articles will also go through important concepts such as data 
structures and algorithms to help get a clearer picture of what 
efficient code looks like. However, it would be beneficial to first 
understand what Big O is to know how to evaluate the efficiency of code.
 This article will introduce you to some of the main points of the Big O
 notation so that you will have a basic understanding of what it is 
about. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Big O is a mathematical 
representation that describes how much time and space an algorithm 
requires as the input grows. We are going to go over 4 different run 
times that are most commonly seen: O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), and O(1). If 
you are afraid of math and feel like this makes no sense already, don&#8217;t 
worry. I will go over this in plain English and will give simple 
examples to illustrate what each of these mean. This also means that the
 explanations in this article will be very basic and will definitely not
 go into as much detail as an academic textbook would, so if you are 
interested in this area then I would recommend taking a longer course on
 this since it is a very significant area in computer science. That 
being said, I do believe that even having a basic understanding of this 
is very valuable and will help you improve the way you code. </p>



<h3>O(n)</h3>



<p>When
 people refer to something as having a run time of O(n), it means that 
it will take as long as the size of &#8220;n&#8221; (the variable). For example, the
 below code would be considered to have O(n) run time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n times. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>If you recall from the <a href="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/programming-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="If you recall from the Programming article, the for loop will run as long as the condition of &quot;i < n&quot; is true. This means that this function will run 5 times if the value of &quot;n&quot; is 5, and 5000 times if the value of &quot;n&quot; is 5000. This has a &quot;linear&quot; run time because the size of &quot;n&quot; is proportionate to how many times it will run at a 1:1 ratio. So in the Search function example above, if the function loops through a million Book entries in alphabetical order, users will have to wait for the function to run a million times before it reaches the end. In the best case (&quot;maybe the book being searched starts with &quot;A&quot;), it might only have to loop through a handful of times before returning the result. Similarly, in the worst case scenario (maybe a Book's name is &quot;ZZZZZZ&quot;), then it will run the whole million times before returning the result. Although this can be very fast if the book's name started with &quot;A&quot;, Big O generally refers to the worst case scenario as its run time. So a simple for loop in this case would be O(n).  (opens in a new tab)">Programming</a> article, the for loop will run as long as the condition of &#8220;i &lt; n&#8221; is true. This means that this function will run 5 times if the value of &#8220;n&#8221; is 5, and 5000 times if the value of &#8220;n&#8221; is 5000. This has a &#8220;linear&#8221; run time because the size of &#8220;n&#8221; is proportionate to how many times it will run at a 1:1 ratio. So in the Search function example above, if the function loops through a million Book entries in alphabetical order, users will have to wait for the function to run a million times before it reaches the end. In the best case (&#8220;maybe the book being searched starts with &#8220;A&#8221;), it might only have to loop through a handful of times before returning the result. Similarly, in the worst case scenario (maybe a Book&#8217;s name is &#8220;ZZZZZZ&#8221;), then it will run the whole million times before returning the result. Although this can be very fast if the book&#8217;s name started with &#8220;A&#8221;, Big O generally refers to the worst case scenario as its run time. So a simple for loop in this case would be O(n). </p>



<h3>O(n^2)</h3>



<p>This is O(n) to the power of 2, which means it runs exponentially slower than O(n). The code below would be considered O(n^2): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	for (j =0; j &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n * n times. ");	<br>	}<br>}</pre>



<p>You can see that there is a for loop nested within a for loop, 
and both of them depend on the size of &#8220;n&#8221;. Which means that if n is 10,
 then both the &#8220;j&#8221; and &#8220;i&#8221; loops have to run 10 times each. Since the 
&#8220;j&#8221; loop is nested within the &#8220;i&#8221; loop, the &#8220;j&#8221; loop has to run 10 times
 before the &#8220;i&#8221; value increments by 1. To finish, &#8220;i&#8221; will also need to 
run 10 times, which means 10 times 10. The point here is that both loops
 depend on the same variable and one of the loops is nested in the 
other. This makes it take exponentially longer to run as the size of n 
increases. </p>



<h3>O(log n)</h3>



<p>This one might be a bit 
more complicated to understand in terms of the code. However, the 
concept is much easier to understand. Algorithms that have a O(log n) or
 logarithmic run time are often regarded as very efficient and scalable.
 The code below is regarded as O(log n): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function divideByTwo(n) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>   if (n == 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else if (n &gt; 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var previousNumber = divideByTwo(n / 2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</pre>



<p>We haven&#8217;t went through &#8220;recursion&#8221; so the above code might 
look a bit confusing (recursion is essentially a function that calls 
itself). The code takes the input &#8220;n&#8221;, prints out the number, then 
divide it by 2, and print out that number, then divide by 2 and so on 
until the resulting number is less than 1. You can see that this is 
scalable because even if the input is a million, if you keep dividing it
 by 2, the number of times this function has to run is still less than 
30. The number of times this function has to run only increases by 1 
every time &#8220;n&#8221; doubles in size. </p>



<p>We implement these kind of 
functions in real life all the time. For example, when you open up a 
dictionary and want to find a word, you only need to flip through the 
dictionary a few times before you find your word even though it may have
 thousands of pages. If the word is &#8220;happy&#8221;, you might start by opening 
the dictionary from the middle. If you reach the &#8220;m&#8221; section, you 
automatically flip back (maybe halfway). If this next section starts 
with &#8220;e&#8221;, then you flip forward again and repeat until you reach the &#8220;h&#8221;
 section to find your word. No matter how big the dictionary is, it is 
always a doable task because you are able to halve your results with 
each flip. This is much more efficient than flipping through each page 
one at a time, similar to what a for loop would do. </p>



<h3>O(1)</h3>



<p>This
 one just means constant time. It doesn&#8217;t depend on any input size, the 
amount of time it runs is always going to be the same. A function like 
below would be considered constant time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function doBunchOfThings() {<br>	console.log("Do something. ");<br>	console.log("Do another thing. ");<br>	console.log("Do even more things. ");<br>	console.log("Keep doing things. ");<br>	console.log("Just do one more thing. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>No matter how many console.log() functions is fit in there, it 
is always going to be O(1) run time because there is no variable input. </p>



<p>There
 are a lot more notations out there and definitely more to analyzing run
 times, however, these are the essential concepts that should give you a
 decent understanding of how to determine the run time of a function. </p>

<p>Testing is an important part of programming that ensures code quality and makes life easier in the long run. </p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p>If
 you are a complete beginner and have next to zero programming 
knowledge, then this section might not make as much sense. It should 
make more sense after making a few small projects and understanding how 
coding works in general. We won&#8217;t actually go deep into testing in these
 series of articles, so you can skim through it if you want, but this is
 definitely an important topic to know about somewhere down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In
 this article, we will briefly discuss the importance of testing code. 
When writing code, it is good practice to write tests for the code as 
well. This way, if you make any changes to the application in the 
future, you can run the tests to see if they still work as intended 
without having to manually test every function again to see if they were
 affected. We will go through a few testing topics below just to get an 
understanding of it. </p>



<h2><strong>Unit Tests</strong></h2>



<p>Unit tests are essentially pieces of code that test other code. For example, if we have the below function in Java:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int x = 1;

int addYToX(int y)&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;return x + y;
}
</pre>



<p>A test for this function could look like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(3, result);
}
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; You can ignore the 
&#8220;public void&#8221; part for now if you are not familiar with it. The main 
point of the first function is to take a variable &#8216;y&#8217; and add it to x, 
which has an initial value of 1. The test below then tests it by giving 
the addYtoX a value of 2. The &#8220;assertEquals&#8221; function then checks to 
verify if adding 2 to x that the function will return 3.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Driven development (TDD)</strong></h3>



<p>This
 is a style of development that is very popular for companies today. TDD
 means that you are writing your tests first before writing the code. 
This makes it more likely for developers to cover more of their code 
with tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, writing tests can also help a person 
write better code. This is because, writing testable code usually 
involves breaking a function down into smaller/testable pieces, which 
prevents functions from getting too convoluted. Making functions 
simpler, more readable, and shorter is usually a good way to prevent 
headaches in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, writing tests also help 
you think about covering edge cases and how the functions should handle 
unexpected input. This can make the code more robust and less likely to 
error out with unusual inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3>



<p>Behaviour
 Driven Development just is a way to write or implement the tests. In 
the above example, we tested whether adding 2 to x will equal 3 if x 
starts at 1. This may work if x is always expect to be 1, but if x 
starts at 2, then we would have to rewrite the test to to check if 
adding 2 to x equals 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent the need of rewriting 
this, we can test the behaviour the function instead of hard-coding 
things in. In this case, the behaviour of the function &#8220;addYToX&#8221; is to 
add the variable y to the variable x, so we can specify that in the test
 instead:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(x + y, result);
}
</pre>



<p>This way instead of changing and specifying the 
expected result each time, the test is saying that the expected result 
should be x + y.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more details on testing, please feel free to refer to this article:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/</a></p>


<p>Most
 programming languages have a unit testing framework to help you get 
started with implementing tests for the project. You can learn more 
about the basics of testing from here:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This article will briefly review through some of the main features of programming that almost all programming languages require. These features make it possible for programs to implement their logic.</p>



<h2>Data Types</h2>



<p>In programming, there are 3 main data types that you will run into (there are a lot more depending on languages, but these should get the point across): </p>



<ul><li>Integers: These are non-decimal numbers (decimals are called Floats). Below, we will define a valid integer in JavaScript. 
var x = 1;</li><li>Strings: These are essentially text. Example for declaring a valid string: <br>
var x = &#8220;This Needs 2 Be Surrounded By Quotes To Be A String!&#8221;;</li><li>Booleans: These are data types that represent true or false: <br>
var x = false; </li></ul>



<p>It is important to know that in JavaScript, you can define almost any of these &#8216;primitive&#8217; data types with the &#8216;var&#8217; keyword. Different programming languages may require different keywords. For example, declaring an integer in Java would look like int x = 1;  </p>



<h2>If Statements</h2>



<ul><li>&#8220;If statements&#8221; help a program detect conditions and perform actions based on the conditions. For example, a self driving car may want the following logic: IF light is GREEN, press gas. If light is RED, stop. </li><li>In the following example, we make a program says &#8220;Go&#8221; if the variable x is Green and &#8220;Stop&#8221; if the variable is Red: </li><li></li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var x = "Green";<br>if (x == "Green")<br>{<br>console.log("Go");<br>}<br>else if (x == "Red")<br>{<br>console.log("Stop");<br>}</pre>



<p>The double equals sign in the parenthesis just means equals, so if (x == &#8220;Green&#8221;) means &#8220;if the variable x equals the text of Green. &#8220;</p>



<p>!= would mean &#8216;does not equal&#8217;. These are called comparators and you can find a list of them here for more details: </p>



<p>Different languages may also have different ways of comparing. For example, in Java, the same statement above would be if (x.equals(&#8220;Green&#8221;)). </p>



<p>If you are using Google Chrome, you can try running this code in your browser by opening the browser&#8217;s developer tools and typing this into the console. </p>



<p>Developer tools can be access by pressing the … button at the top &gt; More Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Click on the tab that says Console.</p>



<p>You can change the x variable to &#8220;Red&#8221; and re-run the code to see what it outputs. </p>



<p>Note:</p>



<p>You may have noticed the squiggly brackets {}. These brackets are used to wrap the code that lets the program know what to do under that if condition. Some people may prefer this format where the brackets are on new lines, however, other people may prefer this format: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var x = "Green";<br>
if (x == "Green") {<br>
  console.log("Go");<br>
} <br>
else if (x == "Red") {<br>
  console.log("Stop");<br>
}</pre>



<p>These are both valid syntax, and as long as the brackets are there to wrap up the code, the way it&#8217;s styled is just preference. If you choose a bracket/indenting style for a project, the important thing is to be consistent with it. </p>



<p>Also, be aware that some languages such as Python might take indentation into consideration for valid code, so if you are following other tutorials for different languages, it is recommended to follow their syntax for the project to avoid headaches. </p>



<h2>Loops</h2>



<p>There are two main types of loops, the For loop and the While loop.</p>



<h3>For Loop</h3>



<p>The For loop looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i=0; i &lt; 3; i++) {<br>
    console.log("Walked staircase number " + i);<br>
}<br>
console.log("Successfully walked 3 levels. ");</pre>



<p>The part that says &#8220;i=0; i &lt; 3; i++&#8221; basically means:</p>



<ol><li>(i=0) Declare the variable &#8220;i&#8221; and that it has a value of 0.</li><li>(i &lt; 3) Continue doing the actions below as long as &#8220;i&#8221; is less than 3.</li><li>(i++) After finishing the actions in the loop, add 1 to the variable &#8220;i&#8221;.</li></ol>



<p>The console.log between the curly braces is the loop. In this case, the program will write &#8220;Walked staircase number i&#8221; 3 time before printing out &#8220;Successfully walked 3 levels. &#8220;</p>



<p>If you run the above code (you can run in it your browser console to see), then the output would be:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Walked staircase number 0<br>Walked staircase number 1<br>Walked staircase number 2<br>Walked staircase number 3<br>Successfully walked 3 levels. <br></pre>



<p>This type of loop will usually be used if you know how many times you want to run a certain function(s) before moving on with the next steps.</p>



<h3>While Loop</h3>



<p>The While loop looks like this (don&#8217;t run this in your browser since it will run forever):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var button = "on";<br>
while (button == "on") {<br>
    console.log("The button is on. ");<br>
}</pre>



<p>This is basically saying to print out &#8220;The button is on. &#8221; while a variable called &#8220;button&#8221; has the value of &#8220;on&#8221;. The functions in here can run forever as long as the button variable does not change. in a real program, there would be a way for this variable to change. For example, there could be a function that sets the button&#8217;s value to be &#8220;off&#8221; when someone clicks on a part of the screen. </p>
