<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this
 article, we will create two roles for the users: the Admin role and 
Normal_User role. Users with the Admin role should have access to create
 and modify books on the website, while normal_users should only be able
 to view the books. </p>



<p>We use the Rolify and CanCanCan gems to help us implement authorization. To start this, go into the console and type: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g rolify Role User
rails generate cancan:ability
rake db:migrate
</pre>



<h2>Roles</h2>



<p>Then go into /app/models/Roles.rb and make sure that it looks like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243</a><br><br></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/ef8fd420d43ecdd442e9c418c6667243.js"></script>



<p>Now we can go into our /db/seeds.rb file and add some roles, books, and sample users. </p>



<p><p>The seeds.rb file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/c67f4e862fedfaa01c47e9934f5663c9.js"></script></p>



<p>Let&#8217;s erase our database and start fresh by typing: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake db:drop db:create db:migrate
</pre>



<p>We can then run the commands in the seeds.rb file by going into our terminal and typing: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake db:seed
</pre>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>The seeds.rb file are 
just a list of database related actions that you want to perform to fill
 up the database with default items. This way you don&#8217;t have to go into 
the Rails console or database to manually enter values each time you 
want to reset your database. In this seeds file, we created 2 roles, 2 
users, and made a loop that created 5 sample book entries. </p>



<h4>Opening the Database<br></h4>



<p>You can check to see if these values were entered into the database successfuly by running the following command to open your database: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sqlitebrowser db/development.sqlite3
</pre>



<p>To browse a table, right click on it and click on 
Browse Table. The books table should have 5 entries, Roles should have 
2, Users 2, and User_Roles. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>The
 &#8216;roles&#8217; table should include the roles that we created, admin and 
normal_user. Each of these should be associated with an id such as 1 and
 2. Each user in the &#8216;users&#8217; table should also have an id associated 
with it. The &#8216;user_roles&#8217; table should have a column called user_id and 
role_id. This is the table that lets the application know which users 
(their ids) are associated with which roles (their ids). In this case, 
it should say that User with an id of 1 (the admin user we created) 
should have the role with an id of 1 (the admin role).</p>



<h4>Authorization</h4>



<p>Now we can begin to implement authorization by permitting certain actions. Lets start by going into the /app/models/user.rb file and add some role checking functions: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">def admin?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has_role?(:admin)
end

def normal_user?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has_role?(:normal_user)
end
</pre>



<p>The user.rb file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/1d2e6a8bfeeb17719bc54320317b221f.js"></script>



<p>These
 functions allow use to check if a user has a certain role. We can use 
this in the /app/models/ability.rb file which helps use define what each
 user can do on the site. Open up the ability.rb file and edit it so 
that it looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f6aaa6e0b839aaf35450a85105728c14.js"></script>



<p>In
 this case, we will allow users to view and create new books, admins can
 manage (create, delete, edit, read) everything, and unauthenticated 
users will only be able to read. For more information on defining 
abilities, please visit: <a href="https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Defining-Abilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan/wiki/Defining-Abilities</a></p>



<h4>Controller</h4>



<p>Now we just have to go into our /app/controllers/api/books_controller.rb file to make sure our controller is checking for permissions before allowing any actions to be performed. At the top (under class BooksController and above the index method), add the following: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">load_and_authorize_resource
before_action :authenticate_user!, except: [:index]
</pre>



<p>The controller should now look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/f8deb96abb3acc0f64d30c47716143e5.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>The
 before_action line will direct users to the login screen if they try to
 access any method in the books controller except for :index. You can 
test this out by logging out and browsing to localhost:3000/api/books to
 see the list of books (this URL is the :index function). Now try to 
visit localhost:3000/api/books/1 (the :show function) and it should 
redirect you to the login page. Once you login, you should be able to 
see the particular book with 1 as the id. </p>



<p>After this, let&#8217;s open up /app/controllers/application_controller.rb and add these lines into the class: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rescue_from CanCan::AccessDenied do |exception|
&nbsp;redirect_to root_url
end
</pre>



<p>This will redirect the user to the home page when 
they try to do something that their user role is not permitted to do. 
Now we have a basic authorization process for the website!</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>Right
 now we can test out the read/get functions like :index and :show, but 
we haven&#8217;t went over the ways of put and post options (creating, 
deleting, or editing). We will implement these functions in the next 
article where we implement React for the front-end of the website. </p>
