<h3>Intro</h3>



<p>When your application has gone live, you will probably want some way of monitoring it. For example, it would be very helpful if you were able to see how many users are visiting your site, where they are visiting from, or if it is even still running at all. This article will go through some free tools that can help you accomplish just that. </p>



<h3>Google Analytics</h3>



<p>Google Analytics can help check how many visitors you get, which location (both geographic and links) they are coming from, and what time people tend tovisit. To get started, create an account here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank">https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</a></p>



<p>The website has a lot of detailed guides on how to use it, but once you see the graphs it should be pretty self explanatory to find the basic information you need. To add Google Analytics to your site, you basically just need to add a JavaScript tag to your website. If you followed the Ruby on Rails tutorial on this site, this can be put in your views files found in /applicationfolder/app/views/. The application layout file is recommended since elements in that file should show up on every page. To get this code snippet, go to Admin &gt; create and account, then create a new property. Fill out the input boxes to generate your script. You can then find it in Admin under the property section under Tracking Info. </p>



<p>It can take 24 hours for it
 to start working. Please note that AdBlocker addons can prevent Google 
Analytics from tracking you (this also means other users using adblocker
 may not be tracked as well). If you are having issues with this, I 
would recommend download the Google Tag Assistant addon (or other Google
 Analytics addons) since it can help provide you more information on any
 errors your website may be having with the script. </p>



<h3>Uptime Robot</h3>



<p>A very simple free service that checks your website every once in a while to see if it is down. You can sign up at their website here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uptimerobot.com/" target="_blank">https://uptimerobot.com/</a> and follow their instructions to send you email notifications whenever a website is detected to be down. </p>



<h3>Nginx Amplify</h3>



<p>If
 you have setup your Nginx server in the previous articles, you can use 
this free tool to monitor your server. You can get information on how 
many visitors/connections you have, what kind of errors users are 
encountering, how often, and how much of your server&#8217;s resources are 
being used. It is a helpful tool to help you monitor the health of your 
server. You can sign up at their website here: <a href="https://amplify.nginx.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://amplify.nginx.com/login</a>
 and follow their instructions to set this up. It is very fast to setup 
and their instructions are very clear and straight-forward. Once you 
have set it up, you can log into their website to check the status of 
your application at your convenience</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>After you have made your website live and accessible by the world, you may want to  give the public a way to find your website. Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) is the practice of making a website more accessible through search  engines. This way when people use search engines like Google to search  for a topic related to your site, your website has a higher chance of  being in the user&#8217;s search results. This article will go through some of  the very basics of SEO that you should be aware of. </p>



<h2>Search Engines</h2>



<p>First,
 let&#8217;s briefly go over what search engines are and how they work. A 
search engine is an application designed to search the internet for 
content. Some examples of search engines would be Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing. When you type in a search term on their website, it searches 
through their index for relevant content and presents it to you. These 
indexes are typically built by using programs called web crawlers. Web 
crawlers are programs that go to websites and visit every link they can 
see from there, while saving all the content that they are able to save.
 This means that if no other website has a link to your website, is it 
unlikely that your website will get found by these crawlers and get 
indexed in the search engines. However, you can submit your URL to these
 services so that they can index it for you. </p>



<h2>SEO</h2>



<p>Some
 SEO methods can also change with time, since it depends on how each 
search engine currently ranks their search results. Sometimes things 
that worked a few years ago may not work as well in the present. For 
example, when search engines were still new you could probably show up 
at the top of the results if you were to spam other websites with links 
to your own website. This is because some search engines will rank 
websites higher in their results if they see a site being referenced 
more, since more references can imply that the website is more credible.
 As a result, some people may employ the use of bots to mass register on
 other people&#8217;s websites and post links to their own site, or even write
 about it in their user profiles to try and trick search engines. 
However, most search engines will change and improve their ranking 
system, so these methods may actually be detrimental to your site&#8217;s 
credibility if done in more recent years. So in the rest of this 
article, we will go through basic things that seem to have remained 
consistent with time. </p>



<h3>Submitting your website</h3>



<p>Most
 search engines will allow you to submit your website&#8217;s URL to them so 
they can start crawling. You can search up each of these search engine 
for instructions on oing so. For example, Google has this page that 
provides further instructions: 
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url</p>



<h3>Title Tags</h3>



<p>Title tags determine what is displayed on search engines as the title. In the picture below, this would be the first line that you see in the Search result (the word &#8220;Google&#8221;). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://localhost/wp-content/uploads/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1191" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1.png 583w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1-300x52.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></figure>



<p>A title tag goes in you &lt;head&gt; part of the HTML document and should something look like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;title&gt;Your Title&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>



<p>This is very important to have since it briefly describes what the page is about. </p>



<h3>Meta Tag Keywords</h3>



<p>You
 may still see this on some sites. This tag includes some keywords that 
are relevant to the page, but may not be used by some of the major 
search engines anymore. The meta tag to include keywords should look 
something like this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;meta name="keywords" content="great, tutorials, simple "&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Meta Tag Description</h3>



<p>The description tag 
briefly summarizes the page and what it is about (in more detail than 
the title). It is recommended to be less than 160 characters. In the 
picture above, this would be the third line. The meta tag to include a 
description should look something like this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;meta name="description" content="Simple tutorials to give an idea what to expect. "&gt;
</pre>



<p>Including the above elements on your 
website will help search engines index your site better. Otherwise, they
 may not know what to display, or see that the site does not have much 
value and rank it very low. There are a lot of other methods you can use
 such as adding back links, reducing loading times, and optimizing 
keywords, but adding the tags above would be a good place to start. You 
can always search for the most relevant SEO tips of the year to get more
 up to date information on this topic. There are SEO tools that help 
automatically assess your website&#8217;s SEO while providing you with tips as
 well. </p>
