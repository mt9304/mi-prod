<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Web
 servers help your web application serve information to clients. You can
 run an application with Rails with just its default application server,
 but it will likely not do too well in a production environment with 
lots of users trying to use the application at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Servers</h2>



<p>There
 are three main web servers used for web applications today: Apache HTTP
 Server, Nginx, and IIS. Setting up servers like Nginx can also allow 
you to scale better when your application gets more users. For example, 
it can act as a load balancer that helps distribute traffic to different
 servers when one server becomes too overloaded with work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brief note on scaling:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There
 are two main types of scaling, scaling vertically and scaling 
horizontally. Scaling vertically in this context means adding more power
 to your machines (for example, more ram, cpu cores, etc). Scaling 
horizontally means adding more machine to help distribute the load. 
Scaling vertically can be very expensive at a certain point and may not 
yield as much performance/dollar when compared to horizontal scaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 servers can also help with configuring things such as SSL (the 
certificate that secures your website and gives it the HTTPS instead of 
HTTP in the URL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article outlines in more detail on the difference between servers:&nbsp;</p>

<p>I
 would also recommend reading more about load balancer and reverse 
proxies since these topics come up pretty often when configuring 
production environments. You likely will not need to know about these 
when starting off, but it is good to know that they exist:&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/</a></p>


<p>We will go over how to use Nginx with Ruby On Rails in the other articles so that you know how to monitor your application. </p>
