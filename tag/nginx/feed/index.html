<h3>Intro</h3>



<p>If you 
have setup your Nginx server on Ubuntu 18.04 then this article will walk
 you through how to add an SSL certificate using Let&#8217;s Encrypt to your 
website so that it uses https instead of http. If you chose to use 
Heroku, then you can skip this article. Please note that this article 
will require you to own a domain name already. This will be a quick 
summary to get you up and running, but a more detailed article on this 
topic can be found here if you are interested: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04 </a></p>



<h3>Setup</h3>



<p>First, let&#8217;s install Certbot:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt install python-certbot-nginx
</pre>



<p>Double check that you have your domains entered 
properly in /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourdomain.com or sudo nano 
/etc/nginx/sites-available/default. There should be a line with 
server_name that follows with your domain. For example: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
</pre>



<p>If you had to make any changes, make sure to open the file as &#8220;sudo&#8221;, save then and run</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl reload nginx
</pre>



<p>If you have your firewall on (you can check its 
status by running sudo ufw status), remember to configure your firewall 
for this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'
</pre>



<p>Then run you can run this to make sure nothing is wrong with the status</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo ufw status
</pre>



<p>Now you can run the following to finish setting up SSL for your website:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com -d www.yourdomain.com
</pre>



<p>This certificate should auto-renew itself when it expires now. </p>



<p>Congratulations, you have just secured your website with SSL and it should be ready for production!</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this
 article, we will deploy our Ruby on Rails application on a Ubuntu 18.04
 server with Nginx (web server) and Puma (application server). We will 
also use PostgreSQL as our database and Rbenv to help us store sensitive
 information. Rbenv helps us store sensitive information (such as 
database passwords) on the server as environment variables. This way if 
your project is on Github as a public project, you won&#8217;t have to reveal 
that kind of information to the world. </p>



<p>If you have created a 
brand new server or VM, remember to install all the dependencies that 
our project needs. I have created a script to help with this (installing
 rails, ruby, git, etc) in case you need here: <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mt9304/scripts/master/rails.sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mt9304/scripts/master/rails.sh</a>. This script can take a while to complete, but you can download and run this on your new server by running: </p>



<p>sudo apt install curl</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mt9304/scripts/master/rails.sh rails.sh<br>sh rails.sh</pre>



<h2>Installing Dependencies<br></h2>



<p>After our environment is setup, let&#8217;s install more dependencies!</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt update<br>sudo apt-get install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev<br>cd ~/.rbenv/plugins<br>git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv-vars.git</pre>



<p>Now let&#8217;s go back to our home directory and clone our project folder here. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ~
</pre>



<p>(Remember to replace [YOUR_USER] and [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] with 
the values that match your own project Github. In my case, it would be: <a href="https://github.com/TestingAndLearning/rails_template" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/TestingAndLearning/rails_template</a>)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git clone https://github.com/[YOUR_USER]/[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]
</pre>



<p>Now change directory into your application&#8217;s folder and run: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev<br>bundle install</pre>



<p>Note: </p>



<p>If you don&#8217;t install libsqlite3-dev and your application references sqlite, then you may get an error like: </p>



<p class="has-text-color has-vivid-red-color">An error occurred while installing sqlite3 (1.3.13), and Bundler cannot continue.</p>



<p class="has-text-color has-vivid-red-color">Make sure that `gem install sqlite3 -v &#8216;1.3.13&#8217;` succeeds before bundling.</p>



<h2>Configuration Changes</h2>



<p>Now
 we will go into the /config/database.yml file and make some changes to 
the Production environment, since this is the environment we will be 
deploying in (Remember to replace the values in quotes with your own). </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">adapter: postgresql
encoding: unicode
database: RT_prod
pool: 5
username: &lt;%= ENV['NAME_OF_YOUR_USER'] %&gt;
password: &lt;%= ENV['YOUR_DATA_BASE_PASSWORD'] %&gt;
</pre>



<p>Your file might look something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/2c8014ffed16adfe072970050f8643ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/2c8014ffed16adfe072970050f8643ae</a></p>



<p>These &lt;%= ENV[&#8216;VALUE&#8217;] %&gt; tags are the environment variables that Rbenv will use. </p>



<p>Now run the following to get a unique value for your application: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rake secret
</pre>



<p>Make sure to copy this down somewhere. Now we can create our rbenv file and add these values: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">nano .rbenv vars
or any other text editor like vi or vim. Then edit the contents in this file to be something like: 
SECRET_KEY_BASE=YOURRAKESECRETOUTPUT
NAME_OF_YOUR_USER=YOURACTUALUSER
YOUR_DATA_BASE_PASSWORD=YOURACTUALPASSWORD
</pre>



<p>Remember to replace the values with your own. These 
should match the ones you entered in the database.yml file. For the user
 value, I would recommend using the value you see when you run: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">echo $USER
</pre>



<p>This way you can avoid some permission issues with the database in the future. </p>



<h4>Git Ignore<br></h4>



<p>Also,
 if you haven&#8217;t already, let&#8217;s create a .gitignore file and make sure we
 ignore this file so that it doesn&#8217;t end up in the git repository. In 
the application folder, create the file by running: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">nano .gitignore
</pre>



<p>Then make sure one of the lines says</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">.rbenv-vars
</pre>



<p>Save the file and run the following to make sure the .gitignore works properly. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git rm -r --cached .
</pre>



<p>Now you can push into your repository and test if the .rbenv-vars file ends up in there. </p>



<h4>More Configurations<br></h4>



<p>Run the following command and remember the number it outputs (this gets the number of CPUs available to use in your server): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">grep -c processor /proc/cpuinfo
</pre>



<p>We can now edit our /config/puma.rb file. Remove the contents in there and make sure it looks something like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/7a444e84098e49ce5d0f92e263f95e21" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/7a444e84098e49ce5d0f92e263f95e21</a></p>



<p>Remember to change the YOURCPUOUTPUT value to the number of CPUs we just found. </p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s go back to your application&#8217;s root directory and run the following to create some required folders: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mkdir -p shared/pids shared/sockets shared/log
</pre>



<p>For the next bit, we will use some scripts I found 
on the internet that will allow you to start/stop the Puma server 
easily. We won&#8217;t go into this in too much detail, but feel free to go to
 <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-puma-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-deploy-a-rails-app-with-puma-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-14-04</a> for a similar guide. Go back to your home directory and download the scripts by running this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ~
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puma/puma/master/tools/jungle/upstart/puma-manager.conf
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puma/puma/master/tools/jungle/upstart/puma.conf
sudo cp puma.conf puma-manager.conf /etc/init
</pre>



<p>Make sure to edit the YOURUSER and YOURAPPLICATIONNAME values so that it leads to your application folder. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cat &lt;&lt; EOF | sudo tee -a /etc/puma.conf
/home/YOURUSER/YOURAPPLICATIONNAME
EOF
</pre>



<p>Note:</p>



<p>The &#8220;cat&#8221; command here helps us write a line, the &#8220;tee&#8221; command takes the output of what we write and writes it in the /etc/puma.conf file. The -a argument makes sure it appends to the end of the file so that it doesn&#8217;t overwrite anything. The &#8220;&lt;&lt; EOF&#8221; part tells the &#8220;cat&#8221; command to take anything in the next lines as output for this, until the word EOF is found on its own line. In ths case, it is the path to your application&#8217;s directory. Then the EOF at the end is detected and it stops writing as output. </p>



<h4>Puma Configuration<br></h4>



<p>For
 your convenience, you can run the following to set your variables in 
this session (Make sure to replace appfoldername with your application&#8217;s
 folder name. Also, if you are using the default user, then you don&#8217;t 
have to set this. You can check the values of these by typing echo $USER
 or echo APP_NAME once you have set them): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">USER=ubuntu
APP_NAME=appfoldername
</pre>



<p>Now we can run the following </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cat &lt;&lt; EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/puma.service
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Modify the path to the app directory and the user and group. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Unit]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Description=Puma HTTP Server
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After=network.target
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Uncomment for socket activation (see below)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Requires=puma.socket
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Service]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Foreground process (do not use --daemon in ExecStart or config.rb)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type=simple
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Preferably configure a non-privileged user
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User=${USER}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Group=${USER}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Specify the path to your puma application root
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WorkingDirectory=/home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Helpful for debugging socket activation, etc.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Environment=PUMA_DEBUG=1
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# EnvironmentFile=/home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}/.env
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# The command to start Puma
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# ExecStart=&lt;WD&gt;/sbin/puma -b tcp://0.0.0.0:9292 -b ssl://0.0.0.0:9293?key=key.pem&amp;cert=cert.pem
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/bundle exec --keep-file-descriptors puma -e production
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/puma -C /home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}/config/puma.rb
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ExecStart=/home/${USER}/.rbenv/shims/bundle exec puma -e production -C ./config/puma.rb config.ru
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIDFile=/home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}/shared/tmp/pids/puma.pid
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart=always
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Install]
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
</pre>



<p>Then restart and enable Puma. </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable puma
</pre>



<h4>Nginx</h4>



<p>Almost done, now we can finally install Nginx: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt-get install nginx
</pre>



<p>And we can replate some default files with our own by running: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cat &lt;&lt; EOF | sudo tee /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;upstream app {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;# Path to Puma SOCK file, as defined previously
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server unix:/home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}/shared/sockets/puma.sock fail_timeout=0;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;listen 80;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;server_name localhost;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;root /home/${USER}/${APP_NAME}/public;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;try_files $uri/index.html $uri @app;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;location @app {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy_pass http://app;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For \$proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy_set_header Host \$http_host;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proxy_redirect off;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;error_page 500 502 503 504 /500.html;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;client_max_body_size 4G;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keepalive_timeout 10;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}
EOF
</pre>



<h4>PostgreSQL Database<br></h4>



<p>Now let&#8217;s create the users for our database and give it the Superuser role. In the below steps, we basically change to use the postgres user, then enter the pg console with psql, which allows us to run SQL commands for our database. Make sure to replace the user and password values with your own, and include the semi colon at the end: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo -iu postgres
psql
CREATE USER username WITH PASSWORD 'yourpassword';
"ALTER USER username WITH SUPERUSER;
\q
exit
</pre>



<p>Note: </p>



<p>&#8220;\q&#8221; exits you from psql and &#8220;exit&#8221; 
takes you back into the default user. While in psql you can also type 
&#8220;\l&#8221; to list all the databases, &#8220;\c databasename&#8221; to connect to a 
database then \dt to list all the tables in that database. You can then 
run SQL commands such as &#8220;SELECT * FROM tablename;&#8221; to interact with 
your database. </p>



<p>The below commands also accomplishes 
the same thing in case you just want to save time (replace the 
YOURPASSWORD value with your password):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c \"CREATE USER $USER WITH PASSWORD '$DB_PASS';\""
sudo -u postgres bash -c "psql -c \"ALTER USER $USER WITH SUPERUSER;\""
</pre>



<p>Now that we have the users avaiable for the 
database, we can set up the Production environment&#8217;s database. Change 
directory into your application&#8217;s folder and run the following (make 
sure your Gemfile has the pg gem in it. There should be a line that says
 something like gem &#8216;pg&#8217;, &#8216;~&gt; 0.18&#8217;: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">RAILS_ENV=production rake db:drop
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:create
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:migrate
RAILS_ENV=production rake db:seed
RAILS_ENV=production rake assets:precompile
</pre>



<h4>Restarting the Server<br></h4>



<p>Finally, we can restart Puma and Nginx and for the changes to take affect:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl stop puma
sudo systemctl start puma
</pre>



<p>or</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl restart puma
</pre>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl stop nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
</pre>



<p>or</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl restart nginx
</pre>



<p>You can run the following to check the status of these servers to make sure that they are action and running: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo systemctl status puma
</pre>



<p>Some of those scripts that we downloaded and used above allow for Puma to be interacted with the systemctl command. </p>



<p>We
 can now visit localhost:80 to check the web application. In 
development, you would usually visit a Rails application through port 
3000, however, Nginx makes it possible to connect it through port 80, 
which is the default port for Production websites. This essentially 
means you can just type localhost in the URL without the port number and
 it should take you to the site. This makes it easier to point your 
domains and such to your server when you decide to go public with your 
website. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>If you find that
 your CSS and JavaScript files are not loading, you can open the 
/config/environments/production.rb file and change the following line to
 true, then restart Puma. </p>



<p>config.public_file_server.enabled = true</p>



<p>Your website should now be ready to go public!</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the Ruby on Rails tutorial in the previous posts, then you should have a basic Ruby on Rails web application on your local machine. The next step would be to move this onto a Production level web server so that the public can access it. In this article, we will go over two common hosting options that you can choose from to bring your web application to Production: Heroku and Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p>



<h2>Heroku</h2>



<p>If
 you are not interested in configuring web servers or setting up 
environments, then Heroku may be suitable for you. For Ruby on Rails 
applications, you can simply use their services to host your project for
 free without having to configure too much. This is great if you just 
want a simple &#8220;push to production&#8221; approach and let Heroku do all the 
server related things. </p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>There is a free tier. </li><li>Easy and quick to get started. </li><li>Can scale easily if you pay for an upgrade. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Scaling to a higher tier can be more expensive compared to other services. </li><li>Free
 tier has limited hours per month and your application will shut down to
 save hours if inactive. This means that the first time you visit the 
website after it is inactive will take longer to load. </li><li>To add 
SSL certificates (make your website https instead of http) you will need
 to upgrade to at least the hobby ($7 a month) plan. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Other</strong></p>



<ul><li>To give your application a custom domain name, it is free, but you need to register your credit. </li><li>Heroku offers a lot more than just hosting, but for our purposes, using it to host is all we will cover. </li></ul>



<h3>Getting Started With Heroku<br></h3>



<p>If you choose to go the Heroku way, then you can skip the next 2 articles since they will be focusing on setting up a web server manually. Here are the instructions to host your web application on Heroku: </p>



<p>Go to their website <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.heroku.com/</a> and sign up then login. Go into your dashboard (<a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps</a>),
 select New in the top right and create a new app. Follow the 
instructions on the page to create your application (remember your 
application name). </p>



<p>Install Heroku CLI</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo snap install --classic heroku
</pre>



<p>Make sure Git is installed</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install git
</pre>



<p>Go into your application directory and run the following and enter your credentials</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Heroku login
</pre>



<p>Replace replaceme with your app name</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:replaceme.git<br>git add . <br>git commit -m "First commit. "<br>git push<br>git push heroku master</pre>



<p>You can visit your website on the Heroku dashboard 
by pressing on Open at in the top right, and it should open up your 
project&#8217;s page with a URL like https://yourapp.herokuapp.com</p>



<h4>Heroku Commands<br></h4>



<p>Every time you want to push to heroku and update your live site, you can just run the commands from &#8220;git add&#8221; to &#8220;git push heroku master. &#8221; You can also tell Heroku to run certain commands on the server by typing something like</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">heroku rake db:create<br>heroku rake db:migrate<br>heroku rake db:seed</pre>



<p>You can basically prepend &#8220;heroku&#8221; to your commands in the terminal then run your usual rails commands to tell it what to do. Running the above rake commands will be necessary most of the times to get your Heroku database up and ready to go. <br></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Before
 using Git, remember to configure your username and name. When you run 
&#8220;git commit&#8221;, it should tell you to configure these with 2 commands if 
you haven&#8217;t already. </p>



<p>If you run into an error saying 
&#8220;Precompiling assets failed. &#8220;, you can try going in in 
config/application.rb, add/edit line to be</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
</pre>



<p>If you run into &#8220;Could not detect rake tasks. &#8220;, you can try running </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
</pre>



<p>If all went smoothly, your website is now in 
Production and can be visited by anyone on the internet! If you now want
 a custom domain, you will have to enter your credit information with 
Heroku to verify your account. Then, you can buy a domain name from a 
company such as GoDaddy or Namecheap and point your domain (&#8220;CName&#8221; or 
&#8220;A record&#8221;) to your app&#8217;s URL and run </p>



<p>heroku domains:add www.yourwebsite.com</p>



<p>Remember
 to replace yourwebsite with your actual domain name. For more 
information on this, please follow their instructions here: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains</a></p>



<p>If
 you chose the Heroku route, then you are done! (for now). The rest of 
this article will just go over AWS and how to set it up. </p>



<h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>



<p>The
 AWS option is basically renting out a remote server from Amazon, and 
configuring it yourself to run a web application. We will be using EC2 
and there is a Free tier for AWS that you can use for a year, there are 
also very cheap servers that can be around $3 a month. </p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>There is a free trial. <br></li><li>Your server doesn&#8217;t deactivate when there is no activity. </li><li>Since you are configuring everything manually, you can find free alternatives for some software/services. For example, the SSL article later on will show you how to obtain an SSL certificate to make your website use https instead of http for free. You can also install your own free server monitoring tools or connect to your server conveniently to make changes. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Can
 require a bit more knowledge to configure web servers and can take 
longer than Heroku to set up. However, once you understand what is 
needed to configure this, you can also write a script to automate the 
process. </li><li>The free tier is only for a year. </li><li>Scaling might not be as straight forward as Heroku. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Other</strong></p>



<ul><li>You may need to register your credit card</li><li>Depending on your plan, you can get unexpected charges if you go over your limits</li><li>We
 won&#8217;t be using a graphical interface to connect to our server, so you 
should be comfortable with using the command line to interact with the 
machine. </li></ul>



<h3>Setting up an AWS server</h3>



<p>Go to their website and sign up for AWS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/</a> then login to their AWS console (you can just Google &#8220;aws console&#8221; if you can&#8217;t find the link on their website). </p>



<p>At the top, click on Services &gt; EC2. Then click on Launch Instance. There will now be 7 steps here to launch your instance. </p>



<p>For
 the first step, you will need to select an AMI, which is basically a 
machine image that your machine will use. So in this case, we want to 
pick a Ubuntu 18.04 image. Search for it (maybe in the marketplace or 
community section) and select it. I selected the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS &#8211; 
Bionic option. </p>



<p>Select the tier that you want to use (there should be a Free tier if you need). For the rest of the steps until 6, you can just stick with the default options. </p>



<h4>Security and SSH<br></h4>



<p>In step 6, you will be configuring security settings. Check Create a new security group and name it. Below that, there should be a table with headers that say Type, Protocol, Port range, and Source. Make sure you create a rule here with Type SSH, TCP Protocol, Port 22, Source Anywhere or your IP. This rule would mean that you are allowed to ssh into your server from anywhere or your ip address (sshing into the machine just means that you can connect to the machine to run commands from your terminal as if it were your own local machine. This also means you will not have a graphical interface for our purposes). For more information on ssh, please refer to this article <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/" target="_blank">https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/</a></p>



<p>Once you have set up this rule, click launch and it should bring up a window to create your key pair. Create a new keypair here, name it, and make sure you download it (there is no way to generate this again so don&#8217;t lose it). Once you click launch, your machine will start being setup and you can check on its status through the Instances menu option on the left. Once the Instance State says it is running, we can ssh into the server to start setting up our application. </p>



<h4>Accessing the Machine<br></h4>



<p>To ssh 
into this machine, open up your terminal and change directory to the 
folder that you saved your ssh key in then run (make your you replace 
your-key-name.pem with your own .pem file&#8217;s name)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">chmod 400 your-key-name.pem
</pre>



<p>The above command &#8220;chmod&#8221; modifies the file&#8217;s permissions to 
allow to you perform the below command properly. For more information on
 the &#8220;chmod&#8221; command, take a look at 
https://isabelcastillo.com/linux-chmod-permissions-cheat-sheet to see a 
list of different permission combinations. </p>



<p>Now you can connect to the server by running</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ssh -i your-key-name.pem ubuntu@18.111.111.11
</pre>



<p>Make sure to replace &#8220;your-key-name.pem&#8221; with the name of your 
own .pem file and also replace the IP address after the @ sign with your
 AWS machine&#8217;s. You can see this in the Instances tab as well. (it 
should be the Public IP or IPv4 Public IP column). </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>By default, AWS Ubuntu AMIs use the user called &#8220;ubuntu&#8221;, which is why we put ubuntu@18.111.111.11 to connect to the server. </p>



<p>You
 should now be connected to your server properly. As you can see, this 
is just another Ubuntu server that you are able to use now!</p>



<p>Now
 if you want to point a custom domain to your website, you can buy a 
domain name from a provider such as GoDaddy or Namecheap and follow the 
instructions here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html</a></p>



<p>Congratulation,
 your AWS server is now up and running! Now our next few articles will 
go over how to set up these servers to be a proper Production 
environment for your application. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Web
 servers help your web application serve information to clients. You can
 run an application with Rails with just its default application server,
 but it will likely not do too well in a production environment with 
lots of users trying to use the application at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Servers</h2>



<p>There
 are three main web servers used for web applications today: Apache HTTP
 Server, Nginx, and IIS. Setting up servers like Nginx can also allow 
you to scale better when your application gets more users. For example, 
it can act as a load balancer that helps distribute traffic to different
 servers when one server becomes too overloaded with work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brief note on scaling:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There
 are two main types of scaling, scaling vertically and scaling 
horizontally. Scaling vertically in this context means adding more power
 to your machines (for example, more ram, cpu cores, etc). Scaling 
horizontally means adding more machine to help distribute the load. 
Scaling vertically can be very expensive at a certain point and may not 
yield as much performance/dollar when compared to horizontal scaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 servers can also help with configuring things such as SSL (the 
certificate that secures your website and gives it the HTTPS instead of 
HTTP in the URL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article outlines in more detail on the difference between servers:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/">https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/</a></p>


<p>I
 would also recommend reading more about load balancer and reverse 
proxies since these topics come up pretty often when configuring 
production environments. You likely will not need to know about these 
when starting off, but it is good to know that they exist:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/</a></p>


<p>We will go over how to use Nginx with Ruby On Rails in the other articles so that you know how to monitor your application. </p>
