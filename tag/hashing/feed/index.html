<h2>Encrypting</h2>



<p>Encrypting
 is the process of turning data into something that is not 
understandable. Decrypting is the process of turning this jumbled 
information back into something readable. This is useful for hiding 
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and contact 
information. You can encrypt information in databases so that only 
authorized people will know how to decrypt it and view the information. </p>



<p>You can also encrypt data when it is transported through a network. For example, submitting payment information through an ecommerce website. We will go over this and how to encrypt your website like this in the later tutorials. <br></p>



<p>Two main types of encrypting information are Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric Encryption.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Symmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this method, the same key can encrypt and decrypt the information.&nbsp; <br></p>



<p>A very simplified illustration of encryption is below</p>



<p><strong>Message</strong>: </p>



<p>  I like apples</p>



<p><strong>Encryption Algorithm: </strong></p>



<p>Makes every letter increase by 1</p>



<p><strong>Encrypted Message: </strong></p>



<p>  j mjlf bqqmft</p>



<p>Send encrypted message</p>



<p>Receive encrypted message</p>



<p>Decrypt by moving every letter back by 1 to get message.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Asymmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In this method, there are two keys involved, 1 for encrypting the information (public key) and one for decrypting the information (private key).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A friendly introduction to asymmetric encryption can be found here: <br><a href="https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e">https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e</a><br></p>



<h2>Hashing</h2>



<p>Hashing
 also turns information into something not understandable. However, the 
algorithms are designed so that it is supposed to be impossible to 
decrypt back into something meaningful. This is a good way to hide 
information if there is need to decrypt the information. For example, 
some media sharing websites may have URLs that look like <a href="http://www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj</a>.
 That text at the end could be a hashed version of a very long title. In
 this case, visiting the URL with jumbled up text will lead to the 
correct video, so there is no need to decrypt it into something 
meaningful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption should be used when there is a need to read the original information. For example, sending emails with confidential information. People will need to be able to read this information, so a way to decrypt the message is necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hashing
 is more secure and should be used if it is not necessary to decrypt the
 information. For example, passwords usually do not need to be 
decrypted. When you create an account for most websites, the password 
you enter does not get stored in the database. The password is hashed, 
and then the resulting hash is stored in the database. So when you 
login, it is comparing the hashed value of what you entered with what is
 stored in the database. This is why &#8220;Forgot my password&#8221; functions do 
not send you your password, because they do not actually keep the 
password in a readable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The main points in this article are:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Encryption prevents unauthorized people from seeing information, and can be decrypted by authorized people to view the information.&nbsp;</li><li>Hashing will mess up information so that it cannot be decrypted into anything meaningful. </li></ul>
