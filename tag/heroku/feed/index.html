<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this article, we will deploy our WordPress website onto Heroku, a web application hosting service. We are using Heroku because it has a free plan, but it does come with a couple of drawbacks. We will also go over the limitations of this in this article. <br></p>



<h2>Heroku</h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start by installing Heroku&#8217;s command line interface by running: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo snap install --classic heroku</pre>



<p>Heroku is a free hosting service that we will use to host our website. The service is extremely convenient to use, but the free tier has a couple of limitations and is usually not suitable for a production/customer facing website hosting. Here are some of the notable downside for the free tier: </p>



<ul><li>If the application is inactive for a while, it will go to sleep. When a user visits the application/website for the first time, it will take more time to load and wake up. </li><li>The MySQL database size is only 5mb. </li><li>It has an ephemeral file system. This just means that any file changes or new files uploaded on the server will be undone after the server restarts. This means that users should not be uploading files on here through WordPress or making any changes tothe files. </li><li>Limited performance. </li></ul>



<p>However, since we will only be using the website here as a development website, these limitations shouldn&#8217;t be too much. If you database does happen to get big and need to go over the 5mb (even with the WordPress database optimizing addon), you have the option to upgrade to their paid tier to significantly increase the limits. </p>



<h3>Heroku Setup</h3>



<p>Make sure you sign up on their website: https://www.heroku.com/<br>
Once you have signed up, you should be able to go to the <a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps">dashboard</a> and create a new application. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku0-1024x84.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2372" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku0-1024x84.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku0-300x25.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku0-768x63.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Enter the name of your new application and in the Deploy section, choose the deployment method that you prefer. For this tutorial, I will choose the Github option to simplify things. This makes it so that every time you move your changes onto Github, it will also move the changes onto Heroku, where we will be hosting our development site. To enable this automatic process, go down to the Automatic deploys section and enable it on the master branch. We won&#8217;t go into detail about Github&#8217;s branches, but you can read more about it here: https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/</p>



<h3>Heroku Database</h3>



<p>Now we need to setup our database on Heroku. Go to the Resources section and click on Find more add-ons. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku1-1024x385.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2373" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku1-1024x385.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku1-300x113.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku1-768x289.png 768w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku1.png 1528w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>In the Data Stores section, find the addon that says ClearDB MySQL and click it. Once you are on that addon&#8217;s page, click on Install ClearDB MySQL and enter your application&#8217;s name to install it for the app (make sure the plan is on Ignite &#8211; Free). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku2-1024x474.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2374" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku2-1024x474.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku2-300x139.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku2-768x355.png 768w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/heroku2.png 1492w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>ClearDB</h3>



<p>Once you have installed the database, you can access this on the Resources tab in Heroku and select ClearDB &#8211; MySQL. This should take you to your database&#8217;s page on ClearDB. From here, you can see your database in the Community Edition tab. It should be called something like heroku_4536dfb43tbdf. Click into this and then go to the System Information tab. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb0-1024x195.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2368" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb0-1024x195.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb0-300x57.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb0-768x146.png 768w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb0.png 1559w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>From here you can see your database&#8217;s username and password. Make sure to make note of this as we will be using it later. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb1-1024x327.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2369" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb1-1024x327.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb1-300x96.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb1-768x245.png 768w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/cleardb1.png 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h3>Local Database</h3>



<p>If you haven&#8217;t already, you can install MySQL Workbench to access your database through a GUI: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install mysql-workbench</pre>



<p>You can then start the program by finding it on the launcher or typing mysql-workbench in the terminal. Once opened, you should be able to click into the Local instance to access your local database. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql0.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2375" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql0.png 726w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql0-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px" /></figure>



<h3>Database Size</h3>



<p>Since our database on Heroku only allows for 5MB, let&#8217;s open up our local instance to check its size. Once opened, the bottom left should have a SCHEMAS section that contains your database. Right-click your database and select &#8220;Set as Default Schema&#8221;. Then click on the textbox in the middle to type in the Query tab and paste this in the box:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">SELECT table_schema AS "Database", <br>
ROUND(SUM(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 2) AS "Size (MB)" <br>
FROM information_schema.TABLES <br>
GROUP BY table_schema;
</pre>



<p>Then go to Query at the top and select &#8220;Execute (All of Selection)&#8221; or press Shift + Ctrl + Return. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2376" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql1.png 806w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql1-300x180.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql1-768x461.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 806px) 100vw, 806px" /></figure>



<p>A results table should show up showing the size of the database right beside the name of your database. If this is under 5MB then we are good to go! If not, then we may have to delete some unnecesarry data from there. You can make use of the &#8220;Optimize Database after Deleting Revisions&#8221; WordPress plugin to delete a lot of data from your database. A lot of the space can be a result of old revisions of posts that you no longer need. </p>



<p>If the above method still does not reduce the database tp below 5MB, then you may need to upgrade the database to a paid tier to continue. </p>



<h3>ClearDB Remote Database</h3>



<p>Let&#8217;s press the Home icon on the top left of MySQL Workbench now and try to connect to our ClearDB database that we just cretaed on Heroku. Click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon next to the title that says &#8220;MySQL Connections&#8221; to start adding another connection. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-2377" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql2.png 1022w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql2-300x208.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/mysql2-768x532.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1022px) 100vw, 1022px" /></figure>



<p>To get the Hostname, go back to your website folder in your terminal and run the following Heroku command (make sure you have installed the Heroku CLI as mentioned at the top): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">heroku config --app yourappname</pre>



<p>Remember to replace yourappname with the name of your application on Heroku. You should get an output that says CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL and a bunch of text after it. The Hostname is the value after the @ sign and before the forward slash &#8220;/&#8221;. It might look something like us-cdbr-iron-east-03.cleardb.net</p>



<h3>Connecting</h3>



<p>The port should be 3305, username/password should be the one we got from the System Information tab on the ClearDB website earlier. The Default Schema is the database name on ClearDB, which should look something like heroku_resgerhreshrhhs3542. It can be found on the System Information tab as well as the part from the heroku config command after the forward slash and before the question mark. Connecting to it may prompt a password, which is the one from the System Information tab. </p>



<p>Once you have tested and saved the connection, the MySQL-Workbench home page should now have an extra tile to connect to this database now. Click into it to make sure everything connects properly. </p>



<h3>Heroku Config Variables</h3>



<p>Now that we have our ClearDB credentails from above, we need to let Heroku know this information. Heroku also similar to our Apache&#8217;s environment variables, Heroku has a section called Config Variables where it gets these values. Go into the Heroku Dashboard again and go to the Settings section. There should be a button called Reveal Config Vars. Click this to reveal the variables. </p>



<p>By default, the ClearDB database URL should be populated already. If not, you can get this URL by running the &#8220;heroku config &#8211;app yourappname&#8221; command again. Since we specified the named of the environment variables in the wp-config.php file earlier (such as DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PASSWORD, DB_HOST), we can add this easily in the Reveal Config Vars section. </p>



<h3>Double Checking</h3>



<p>Make sure to add all the environment variables that we have defined in this area and fill the values in with the ClearDB values. Double check that there are no trailing or prepended spaces in these values that are not supposed to be there.</p>



<p>Now check that your file changes are all on the remote repository on Github. You can go to your website folder and type &#8216;git status&#8217; to check if there are any changes that need to be put on there. Once everything is up to date there, you can manually deploy the changes to Heroku by going to the Heroku Dashboard &gt; Deploy and scroll to the Manual Deploy section to deploy. </p>



<h3>Pushing Database Changes</h3>



<p>Right now our ClearDB database is blank, so we want to make sure we move our local database values onto the ClearDB database. To do this, we will create a backup file from our local database, then restore it to the ClearDB one. Let&#8217;s start by creating a new folder on our machine to store the database files: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mkdir ~/mysql-db-files
cd ~/mysql-db-files
</pre>



<p>Make sure you don&#8217;t create these files in your website&#8217;s folder, because it contains sensitive information and can accidentally be pushed into Github if not careful. Once you are in this new folder, you can then then run the following to create the database backup file: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mysqldump -u root -pCHANGEME databasename &gt; nameofoutputfile.sql</pre>



<p>Make sure &#8220;root&#8221; is changed to your user and the CHANGEME value right after -p (no space in between) is your database user&#8217;s password. Remember to change the databasename to the name of your own database on your local machine. Then the part after the right angle bracket &#8220;&gt;&#8221; is just the name that you want the file to be called (make sure it ends with .sql).</p>



<h3>Double Checking</h3>



<p>Run the &#8220;ls&#8221; command just to check that your file has been created. Now we can run the next command to restore our ClearDB database using this file: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mysql --host=changeme --user=changeme --password=changeme --reconnect heroku_changeme &lt; nameofoutputfile.sql</pre>



<p>Make sure you change all these values to the ones we got for the ClearDB database above and the filename at the end to the one we just generated. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
You will likely get an error that says: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ERROR 1273 (HY000) at line 25: Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_unicode_ci'</pre>



<p>If that happens, you can read about why this occurs here so you can make a more informed decision: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42385099/1273-unknown-collation-utf8mb4-unicode-520-ci">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42385099/1273-unknown-collation-utf8mb4-unicode-520-ci</a></p>



<p>If you just want to resolve this quick and don&#8217;t care about the details/implicates, you can just run the following: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sed -i -e "s/utf8mb4_unicode_ci/utf8mb4_unicode_ci/g" nameofoutputfile.sql</pre>



<p>Just make sure to change the filename at the end to the file we just generated. This command just replaces the text that is causing issues in our database file. After running it, you can try running the mysql command again to make the changes again. You can now go into MySQL-Workbench again, refresh everything and see if the ClearDB database has received all the changes. </p>



<h3>WordPress URL Values</h3>



<p>One thing to watch out for are the URLs stored in the database. While you are connected to the ClearDB database with MySQL-Workbench, run the following command to see the WordPress options table: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">SELECT * FROM wp_options;</pre>



<p>You should notice some columns called &#8220;siteurl&#8221; and &#8220;home&#8221;. These are currently set to http://www.mediocreinventions.com/, but when you have deployed this to Heroku, it would be a different URL. You can find this URL by going into the Heroku Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; and scroll down to the Domains and Certificates section. You should be able to see your application&#8217;s URL on Heroku that looks something like https://yourappname.herokuapp.com/</p>



<p>We should replace the localhost URL in our ClearDB database to avoid issues. Run the following SQL Query on the ClearDB database to update this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">update wp_options<br>
set option_value = "http://yourappname.herokuapp.com"<br>
where option_name = "siteurl";<br>

update wp_options<br>
set option_value = "http://yourappname.herokuapp.com"<br>
where option_name = "home";
</pre>



<p>Make sure that this is set to http instead of https. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong><br>
Please note that we will not be able to use https properly in this tutorial, since if you are using a custom domain name, you will have to upgrade to a paid plan to implement SSL certificates. If you plan to use the default Herokuapp domain, then it might require more steps to get https to work. I may write an article on this in the future, but for now we will work with this. </p>



<p>Once this is done, run the SELECT command again to see if it has changed properly. </p>



<h3>Visiting the Site</h3>



<p>With all the changes being made, let&#8217;s restart our application by going to the Heroku dashboard, click on More and select Restart all Dynos. Now you can visit your site&#8217;s URL and see the error that shows up!</p>



<p>If it says something about a database error, check your wp-config.php file to make sure the database values are correct and you didnt mispell anything. Since we are using environment variables for them, you can also have to check the Reveal Config Vars section in the Heroku Settings section to see if anything was entered wrong (for example, unexpected trailing or prepended spaces). </p>



<p>If you get an error saying the site redirected too many times, check your database value for the siteurl and home columns and make sure that their values are NOT https and the domain name matches what is listed on Heroku. If you have made changes and it keeps trying to redirect you to the https site, the redirect might be cached in your browser. In that case you can either clear your browse cache or try browsing in a new incognito tab. </p>



<p>If your CSS (styling) of the website is all off, but the page loads the content, then double check that your website is serving everything through http and your current URL is using http. </p>



<p>Once the website is loading properly, you can visit the login page as normal by going into /wp-login.php or your custom login URL if you have configured it. </p>



<h3>Workflow</h3>



<p>If you have followed through everything in these series of tutorials, then these are the current things that we have: </p>



<ul><li>Local WordPress website (local database, files, server, etc). Visited through http://www.mediocreinventions.com/</li><li>Github remote repository for files. </li><li>Heroku remote for files (ephemeral). </li><li>ClearDB remote database. Visited through http://yourappname.herokuapp.com/ </li></ul>



<p>Since the Heroku file system is ephemeral, you would not be able to login to the Heroku instance and upload files (pictures, media, etc) through the website. The files would just get deleted once the instance is restarted. In this case, everytime you want to make changes to the files or add posts that include pictures, you should make them on your local instance and push the file changes to Github/Heroku and the Database changes to ClearDB. </p>



<h3>Workarounds</h3>



<p>This all seems very tedious, but the benefit of this is that everything we use here in this series of tutorials is free. If you don&#8217;t like the ephemeral file system of Heroku, you can just avoid it by using AWS and spinning up your own web server to host your WordPress site. They also have a free trial for a year and a very cheap (around $3 a month) plan. </p>



<p>To make life easier for pushing database changes between your ClearDB and your local database, I have created some scripts below to help with this. </p>



<p>This one creates a database backup file and pushes it from your local database to ClearDB. It automatically modifies the siteurl and home values to your Herokuapp url. Make sure to change all the values to match yours if you want to use it (database name, user, siteurl, etc). </p>



<p>I have named the file local_to_cleardb.sh to be self explanatory. Make sure to run this in a folder NOT within your website folder by running: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">bash local_to_cleardb.sh</pre>



<p>This file (cleardb_to_local.sh) does the opposite and creates a backup database file from your ClearDB database and restores it onto your local database. Make sure to change all the values in this as well and run it in a folder that is NOT your website folder: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">bash cleardb_to_local.sh</pre>



<h3>Other Notes</h3>



<p>I might also look into making a plugin in the future to work around the ephemeral file system. </p>



<p>Alternatively, you can also find some plugins that save the media on Amazon S3 instead of the Website file system. The cost can be around $0.023 per GB for the first 50TB so it&#8217;s almost free. </p>



<p>Since the free Heroku instance might not be able to handle a lot of traffic, we will only use the Heroku site as a development site if you need to add some text-only posts from other devices. We will add more to the workflow in the next tutorial as well so that we can have a website that can actually handle more traffic and activity (for free!). </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the Ruby on Rails tutorial in the previous posts, then you should have a basic Ruby on Rails web application on your local machine. The next step would be to move this onto a Production level web server so that the public can access it. In this article, we will go over two common hosting options that you can choose from to bring your web application to Production: Heroku and Amazon Web Services (AWS)</p>



<h2>Heroku</h2>



<p>If
 you are not interested in configuring web servers or setting up 
environments, then Heroku may be suitable for you. For Ruby on Rails 
applications, you can simply use their services to host your project for
 free without having to configure too much. This is great if you just 
want a simple &#8220;push to production&#8221; approach and let Heroku do all the 
server related things. </p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>There is a free tier. </li><li>Easy and quick to get started. </li><li>Can scale easily if you pay for an upgrade. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Scaling to a higher tier can be more expensive compared to other services. </li><li>Free
 tier has limited hours per month and your application will shut down to
 save hours if inactive. This means that the first time you visit the 
website after it is inactive will take longer to load. </li><li>To add 
SSL certificates (make your website https instead of http) you will need
 to upgrade to at least the hobby ($7 a month) plan. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Other</strong></p>



<ul><li>To give your application a custom domain name, it is free, but you need to register your credit. </li><li>Heroku offers a lot more than just hosting, but for our purposes, using it to host is all we will cover. </li></ul>



<h3>Getting Started With Heroku<br></h3>



<p>If you choose to go the Heroku way, then you can skip the next 2 articles since they will be focusing on setting up a web server manually. Here are the instructions to host your web application on Heroku: </p>



<p>Go to their website <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.heroku.com/</a> and sign up then login. Go into your dashboard (<a href="https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps</a>),
 select New in the top right and create a new app. Follow the 
instructions on the page to create your application (remember your 
application name). </p>



<p>Install Heroku CLI</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo snap install --classic heroku
</pre>



<p>Make sure Git is installed</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install git
</pre>



<p>Go into your application directory and run the following and enter your credentials</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Heroku login
</pre>



<p>Replace replaceme with your app name</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git remote add heroku git@heroku.com:replaceme.git<br>git add . <br>git commit -m "First commit. "<br>git push<br>git push heroku master</pre>



<p>You can visit your website on the Heroku dashboard 
by pressing on Open at in the top right, and it should open up your 
project&#8217;s page with a URL like https://yourapp.herokuapp.com</p>



<h4>Heroku Commands<br></h4>



<p>Every time you want to push to heroku and update your live site, you can just run the commands from &#8220;git add&#8221; to &#8220;git push heroku master. &#8221; You can also tell Heroku to run certain commands on the server by typing something like</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">heroku rake db:create<br>heroku rake db:migrate<br>heroku rake db:seed</pre>



<p>You can basically prepend &#8220;heroku&#8221; to your commands in the terminal then run your usual rails commands to tell it what to do. Running the above rake commands will be necessary most of the times to get your Heroku database up and ready to go. <br></p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Before
 using Git, remember to configure your username and name. When you run 
&#8220;git commit&#8221;, it should tell you to configure these with 2 commands if 
you haven&#8217;t already. </p>



<p>If you run into an error saying 
&#8220;Precompiling assets failed. &#8220;, you can try going in in 
config/application.rb, add/edit line to be</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false
</pre>



<p>If you run into &#8220;Could not detect rake tasks. &#8220;, you can try running </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile
</pre>



<p>If all went smoothly, your website is now in 
Production and can be visited by anyone on the internet! If you now want
 a custom domain, you will have to enter your credit information with 
Heroku to verify your account. Then, you can buy a domain name from a 
company such as GoDaddy or Namecheap and point your domain (&#8220;CName&#8221; or 
&#8220;A record&#8221;) to your app&#8217;s URL and run </p>



<p>heroku domains:add www.yourwebsite.com</p>



<p>Remember
 to replace yourwebsite with your actual domain name. For more 
information on this, please follow their instructions here: <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/custom-domains</a></p>



<p>If
 you chose the Heroku route, then you are done! (for now). The rest of 
this article will just go over AWS and how to set it up. </p>



<h2>Amazon Web Services (AWS)</h2>



<p>The
 AWS option is basically renting out a remote server from Amazon, and 
configuring it yourself to run a web application. We will be using EC2 
and there is a Free tier for AWS that you can use for a year, there are 
also very cheap servers that can be around $3 a month. </p>



<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>



<ul><li>There is a free trial. <br></li><li>Your server doesn&#8217;t deactivate when there is no activity. </li><li>Since you are configuring everything manually, you can find free alternatives for some software/services. For example, the SSL article later on will show you how to obtain an SSL certificate to make your website use https instead of http for free. You can also install your own free server monitoring tools or connect to your server conveniently to make changes. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>



<ul><li>Can
 require a bit more knowledge to configure web servers and can take 
longer than Heroku to set up. However, once you understand what is 
needed to configure this, you can also write a script to automate the 
process. </li><li>The free tier is only for a year. </li><li>Scaling might not be as straight forward as Heroku. </li></ul>



<p><strong>Other</strong></p>



<ul><li>You may need to register your credit card</li><li>Depending on your plan, you can get unexpected charges if you go over your limits</li><li>We
 won&#8217;t be using a graphical interface to connect to our server, so you 
should be comfortable with using the command line to interact with the 
machine. </li></ul>



<h3>Setting up an AWS server</h3>



<p>Go to their website and sign up for AWS <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://aws.amazon.com/</a> then login to their AWS console (you can just Google &#8220;aws console&#8221; if you can&#8217;t find the link on their website). </p>



<p>At the top, click on Services &gt; EC2. Then click on Launch Instance. There will now be 7 steps here to launch your instance. </p>



<p>For
 the first step, you will need to select an AMI, which is basically a 
machine image that your machine will use. So in this case, we want to 
pick a Ubuntu 18.04 image. Search for it (maybe in the marketplace or 
community section) and select it. I selected the Ubuntu 18.04 LTS &#8211; 
Bionic option. </p>



<p>Select the tier that you want to use (there should be a Free tier if you need). For the rest of the steps until 6, you can just stick with the default options. </p>



<h4>Security and SSH<br></h4>



<p>In step 6, you will be configuring security settings. Check Create a new security group and name it. Below that, there should be a table with headers that say Type, Protocol, Port range, and Source. Make sure you create a rule here with Type SSH, TCP Protocol, Port 22, Source Anywhere or your IP. This rule would mean that you are allowed to ssh into your server from anywhere or your ip address (sshing into the machine just means that you can connect to the machine to run commands from your terminal as if it were your own local machine. This also means you will not have a graphical interface for our purposes). For more information on ssh, please refer to this article <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/" target="_blank">https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/</a></p>



<p>Once you have set up this rule, click launch and it should bring up a window to create your key pair. Create a new keypair here, name it, and make sure you download it (there is no way to generate this again so don&#8217;t lose it). Once you click launch, your machine will start being setup and you can check on its status through the Instances menu option on the left. Once the Instance State says it is running, we can ssh into the server to start setting up our application. </p>



<h4>Accessing the Machine<br></h4>



<p>To ssh 
into this machine, open up your terminal and change directory to the 
folder that you saved your ssh key in then run (make your you replace 
your-key-name.pem with your own .pem file&#8217;s name)</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">chmod 400 your-key-name.pem
</pre>



<p>The above command &#8220;chmod&#8221; modifies the file&#8217;s permissions to 
allow to you perform the below command properly. For more information on
 the &#8220;chmod&#8221; command, take a look at 
https://isabelcastillo.com/linux-chmod-permissions-cheat-sheet to see a 
list of different permission combinations. </p>



<p>Now you can connect to the server by running</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ssh -i your-key-name.pem ubuntu@18.111.111.11
</pre>



<p>Make sure to replace &#8220;your-key-name.pem&#8221; with the name of your 
own .pem file and also replace the IP address after the @ sign with your
 AWS machine&#8217;s. You can see this in the Instances tab as well. (it 
should be the Public IP or IPv4 Public IP column). </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>By default, AWS Ubuntu AMIs use the user called &#8220;ubuntu&#8221;, which is why we put ubuntu@18.111.111.11 to connect to the server. </p>



<p>You
 should now be connected to your server properly. As you can see, this 
is just another Ubuntu server that you are able to use now!</p>



<p>Now
 if you want to point a custom domain to your website, you can buy a 
domain name from a provider such as GoDaddy or Namecheap and follow the 
instructions here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/routing-to-ec2-instance.html</a></p>



<p>Congratulation,
 your AWS server is now up and running! Now our next few articles will 
go over how to set up these servers to be a proper Production 
environment for your application. </p>
