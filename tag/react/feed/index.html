<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This article is going to be a very brief 
rundown of what React.js is and how to use it with your application. 
React is a very popular JavaScript library and there are a lot of 
courses out there that can teach you its ins and outs in detail. 
However, if you just want to get up and running and figure out the 
details later when you need to, then this article with go through just 
that. We will cover how to Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects in 
our database using React and AJAX to interact with our Rails API. </p>



<p>React
 is a JavaScript library that allows developers to create a website&#8217;s UI
 by using small pieces of code (JavaScript files called Components). You
 can use these components to display dynamic data (eg: data from your 
api or database) as well as static elements (regular HTML elements like 
&lt;p&gt; or even &lt;script&gt; snippets for regular JavaScript). This 
allows for a cleaner and more maintainable way to build your front-end 
compared to writing massive custom JavaScript and HTML files. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>For more information on this topic, you can find a similar tutorial here: <a href="https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/</a></p>



<p>This
 tutorial is based on the above article, however, they seem to be using 
an older version of React so some of the functions might not work 
anymore. If you followed that tutorial and created the React components 
with React.createClass, then you might run into some JavaScript errors 
in your browser console such as </p>



<p>TypeError: React.createClass is not a function</p>



<p>This
 is because React.createClass is no longer used for creating components.
 This article will aim to make this work using React 16.2, Rails 5.2 and
 the latest version of JavaScript at this time (2018). </p>



<h2>React</h2>



<p>In
 our setup article, we ran rails g react:install to setup React to work 
with Rails. Now we can focus on creating the components. React&#8217;s 
components are stored in the /apps/assets/javascripts/components/ 
folder. We can start by creating a new folder here called book inside of
 this components folder, then create a new file here called 
book_app.js.jsx. Your folder stucture should now be as such: 
/apps/assets/javascripts/components/book/book_app.js.jsx. </p>



<p>Now let&#8217;s populate this book_app component with code so that it looks like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c</a></p>



<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/3d165e7b5f052d5595ad7bdc564b3f6c.js"></script>



<p>If
 you are curious, you can find out more about React functions at their 
website here: https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html. However, if
 you just want the cliff notes of what is relevant in this project, I 
will explain it here. </p>



<p>You declare a React component with the line: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">class BookApp extends React.Component { 
...
} 
</pre>



<p>Inside this class, there are certain default functions that 
React will load in a set order. The functions are called: constructor(),
 static getDerivedStateFromPropers(), render(), and componentDidMount().
 So everytime you load a React component on a page, these functions will
 be called in that order. The constructor() initiates the component and 
the render() function renders the HTML for the page. Then if that state 
of the component changes, the render() function gets called again. </p>



<h4>React Workflow<br></h4>



<p>Here is the general flow of what is happening here in our component: </p>



<p>The
 constructor initiates the component in our BookApp by setting the state
 with an empty array of &#8220;books&#8221;. The &#8220;state&#8221; in this case can be thought
 of as the place to store variables so that our page can use it and 
render dynamic content. Then it renders text that says &#8220;Loading&#8230;&#8221; for a
 bit before calling componentDidMount(), which runs a custom function we
 created called getDataFromApi(). This function then uses AJAX 
(basically JavaScript that can interact with our API) to get Book data 
from our database and store it in the &#8220;state&#8221;. Now that the state has 
changed again, render is called and updates the &#8220;Loading&#8230;&#8221; to &#8220;Your 
books will go here!&#8221;. </p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>The getDataFromApi()
 function stores variables called error and isLoaded in the state, and 
sets their values depending on how the API called goes. This helps with 
troubleshooting because the render() function will print out errors if 
it does run into any. </p>



<h4>Rendering</h4>



<p>Now that we have the component, lets go into /app/views/homepage/index.html.erb and change it so that it renders our component instead of the default text. Replace everything in the index.html.erb file with: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;%= react_component 'BookApp' %&gt;
</pre>



<p>This tells the application to render the React component we just created. You can start your server again and refresh the page to see it. Your page should now look like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://mediocreinventions.herokuapp.com/wp-content/uploads/books.png" alt="" class="wp-image-921" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books.png 955w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books-300x63.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/books-768x161.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px" /></figure>



<p>Now
 we can work on populating this area with a table to render all our book
 entries. Fortunately, React allows you to render other components 
within a component so that we don&#8217;t have to stack one file with so much 
code. So let&#8217;s start by creating some new files called book_table.js.jsx
 and book.js.jsx in the same folder as book_app.js.jsx. Fill out the 
table file so that it looks like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/fe72fac20278203c3ece7263536a741e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/fe72fac20278203c3ece7263536a741e</a> and the book file should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/266b22788e8a7f6144c026abffbc9441" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/266b22788e8a7f6144c026abffbc9441</a></p>



<p>If all went well, then you page should now look something like this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://mediocreinventions.herokuapp.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-1024x459.png" alt="" class="wp-image-922" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-1024x459.png 1024w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-300x135.png 300w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table-768x344.png 768w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/book_table.png 1055w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Now you should have a working delete button that should delete the entries when clicked! You can then implement the rest of the functions as you would like to build on this application. For some examples on implementing adding and editing with React, this article seems to cover the rest: <a href="https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/">https://www.nopio.com/blog/react-rails-part-1-tutorial/</a></p>



<p>For our purposes, this basic application should be enough to deploy to a Production environment. The next articles will go through some common options for hosting your web application. <br></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this series of tutorials, we will go through how to build a Rails application with  authentication/authorization. We will briefly go over what each function does and set up a bare-bones application template to use with React.js.This particular article will focus on just setting up the environment so that we can start the project. </p>



<p>To  make sure you are on the same page, you can start on a brand new virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.04. You can download virtual machines  from here:&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.vmware.com/ca.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.vmware.com/ca.html</a> for VMware (free for Windows) or <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a> for VirtualBox (free for MacOS and Windows).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ubuntu Desktop operating system can be download here: <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://www.ubuntu.com/download</a> or if 18.04 is not the latest version anymore, you can also check here: <a href="http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/</a></p>



<h2>Start</h2>



<p>To start, we will install the dependencies needed to install Ruby on Rails:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Open
 up the terminal by pressing ctrl + alt + T and type in the following to
 start installing (make sure you wait for each command to finish before 
running the next):&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Install Git for version control</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install git
</pre>



<h3>Install libraries and other dependencies</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
sudo apt install autoconf bison build-essential libssl-dev libyaml-dev libreadline6-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libffi-dev libgdbm-dev
</pre>



<h3>Installs RVM for managing Ruby environments</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>If at any point the 
terminal says you have not installed or function is not found when you 
have just installed the program succesfully, an easy workaround is just 
close the terminal and open it again. You can also type source ~/.bashrc
 or source ~/.bash_profile to see if it works. If it still doesn&#8217;t work,
 make sure the program was properly installed and there were no error 
messages in the logs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Continue setting up ruby environment</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rbenv install 2.5.1
rbenv global 2.5.1
echo "gem: --no-document" &gt; ~/.gemrc
gem install rails -v 5.2.0
rbenv rehash
</pre>



<h3>Install NodeJS (JavaScript Runtime environment)</h3>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd /tmp
\curl -sSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x -o nodejs.sh
cat /tmp/nodejs.sh | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install -y nodejs
</pre>



<h3>Cleanup</h3>



<p>Almost done the setup, let&#8217;s do some cleaning up and updating just to be sure</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ~/.rbenv
git pull
cd ~
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
sudo apt update
</pre>



<p>Now we should be ready to begin creating the app.</p>



<h2>Creating The App</h2>



<p>Create the application</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails new rails_template
cd rails_template
</pre>



<p>Make sure you have installed a text editor so that we can edit some files For Sublime text install, do:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">wget -qO - https://download.sublimetext.com/sublimehq-pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://download.sublimetext.com/ apt/stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/sublime-text.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sublime-text
</pre>



<p>For Vim install, do:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install vim
</pre>



<h4>Gemfile</h4>



<p>Then open up the Gemfile edit it to include the proper gems. In particular, we are going to need Devise for authentication and CanCanCan for authorization. Authentication would mean the parts responsible for logging in a user, whereas authorization would be permissions for which types of users (roles) are allowed to do certain actions. These are usually very important for people to define in projects, since you wouldn&#8217;t want a guest to be able to access Admin level functions (such as deleting users).&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Gemfile should look like this: <a href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/78c1ab6274d92629758b05c258def17e.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>If you are unfamiliar with gems, you can think of them as additional programs, plugins/extensions, or libraries that the application can use. </p>



<h4>Turbo Links<br></h4>



<p>We also need to remove Turbo Links since it can cause  issues with some of the other technologies we are going to use later  on. Remove the &#8220;//= require turbolinks&#8221; line from  app/assets/javascripts/application.js. Remove the two  &#8220;data-turbolinks-track&#8221; =&gt; true hash key/value pairs from your  app/views/layouts/application.html.erb. </p>



<p>
The application.html.erb file  should look like this: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292" target="_blank">https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292﻿</a></p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/mt9304/6028e18397f0af7748d3df76fe4b9292.js"></script>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>The
 application.html.erb file here determines how your pages should look. 
In general, all your pages in this application will use the HTML here 
for its layout, and the &lt;%= yield %&gt; tag is the part that changes 
depending on the page. </p>



<h4>Database</h4>



<p>After this, let&#8217;s run the following to install our database</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install libsqlite3-dev
sudo apt install sqlite3
</pre>



<p>We will change to using Postgres database later</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Sqlite
 is a lightweight database good for development, but not that great at 
handling a lot of connections. So we will use Postgresql later on when 
we move it into production.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that we have saved the new Gemfile, run the following command inside the application&#8217;s directory to install the gems:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">bundle install
</pre>



<h4>React</h4>



<p>Let&#8217;s generate the files for React so we can use them later on:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails g react:install
</pre>



<p>After everything has been installs, run the 
following to start the server, then visit localhost:3000 to see if the 
application started successfully.&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rails s
</pre>



<p>If all is successful so far, it should say Yay! you&#8217;re on Rails!</p>



<p>To stop the application server from running, press <strong>CTRL+ C</strong> at the terminal to stop the process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Now that the application is up and running, we can start making a basic API. </p>
