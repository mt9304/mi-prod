<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Knowing
 various data structures can be very beneficial when creating 
applications. For example, some data structures are faster to search 
through and some will be faster for inserting data. Depending on what 
your use case is, knowing when to use certain data structures and when 
to avoid certain ones can help your application scale and perform a lot 
better.&nbsp;This article will go through some of the most important data 
structures that are implemented in various programming languages. </p>



<h3>Array</h3>



<p>Arrays can be declared in JavaScript like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var myArray = ["firstValue", "secondValue", "thirdValue"];
</pre>



<p>Arrays store values in different indices and it can 
be access quickly. In the above example, you can run the following to 
get the first value stored in the array:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">console.log(myArray[0]);
</pre>



<p>The [0] is saying to look at index number 0, or the 
very first thing inside the array (the count starts from 0, not 1). So 
running myArray[1] would get the second value of &#8220;secondValue&#8221;. If you 
already know the index of where the value is going to be stored, 
accessing this value can be very efficient since it runs at constant 
time, or O(1). However, if you didn&#8217;t know the index of where the value 
is, you may have to write a function to search through the array. In 
that case, it can longer. For example, the following snippet will loop 
from the whole array to find the value it needs, giving it a linear 
runtime, or O(n):&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (var i = 0; i &lt; myArray.length; i++) {<br>	if (myArray[i] == "thirdValue") {<br>		console.log("Found it!");<br>	}<br>}</pre>



<p>Inserting and deleting values in the array can also 
take just as long, since it has to move all the existing other values to
 fill the gap.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Linked List</h3>



<p>A linked list is a 
collection of data that is saved in a linear way. Each element points to
 the next element so that it knows which order it is in. For example, 
below is a visualization of how a linked list might look like:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Winter =&gt; Spring =&gt; Summer =&gt; Fall</p>



<p>In
 the above example, the first item in the list is &#8220;Winter&#8221;, and it knows
 that its next element will be Spring. Spring will then only know its 
next element is Summer, and so on. A linked list is very useful if you 
want to insert or delete values very often, since it would have a 
constant execution time, or O(n). This is because you would only have to
 change the pointers of the elements if you wanted to insert something, 
instead of moving all the other elements around. For example, if we 
wanted to insert an element between Spring and Summer called 
&#8220;Springish&#8221;, then the process of inserting would be to just change the 
Spring pointer to Springish and make sure the Springish pointer is set 
to Summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>When 
inserting at a specific index of a long linked list, you may still have 
to traverse through the list at a linear execution time to search and 
find the position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A &#8220;Doubly Linked List&#8221; is a data structure 
that points in both directions. So each element knows both its previous 
and next element. This allows for it to traverse both ways through the 
list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would recommend looking through this article to get a better idea of how to implement a linked list: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-linkedlist-javascript/">https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/implementation-linkedlist-javascript/</a></p>



<h3>Hash Map</h3>



<p>A hash map stores key value pairs and is generally very fast when performing searches, insertion, and deletion. On average, it should have a constant execution time for these actions, but it can also take linear time in the worst case scenario.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>This
 is going to be a very simplified explanation of the data structure. The
 Encryption article briefly explain hashing if you have not learned it 
yet, or you can read from here: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function</a></p>



<p>Below is a pseudo-code snippet of a hash map that stored the names of different animals:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">myHashMap = { "dog" =&gt; "Skippy", "cat" =&gt; "Garfield", "squirrel" =&gt; "Ralph" }
</pre>



<p>To map the values, the value of dog may be hashed to
 become a number like 4. In that case, the value of &#8220;dog&#8221; would be 
stored in an array-like structure at the 4th index. Since arrays have 
constant access time, searching for a value in the hash map will be 
constant in this case, since it just has to find the 4th index and 
retrieve the value stored in there (which would be &#8220;Skippy&#8221;). However, 
if another word happens to be hashed into 4, then they will both share 
the same index. If all of the items happened to fall in the 4th index, 
then it could take linear execution time to traverse through that bucket
 before finding the value. This collision here can be handled 
differently depending on the developer, but it is usually handled like a
 linked list.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>You may 
see a lot of resources reference Hash Table and Hash Map. They are 
similar data structures, but do have a few differences. A good 
explanation of this can be found here: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40471/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40471/differences-between-hashmap-and-hashtable</a></p>



<h3>Binary Tree</h3>



<p>A
 binary tree is made up of a bunch of nodes, and each node points to 2 
other nodes, the left and the right. Below would be a visualization of a
 tree (you can also google a binary tree visualization for a proper 
image):&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">       (5)<br>      /   \<br>    (3)   (7)<br>   / \     / \<br>(2) (4)   (6) (8)</pre>



<p>For each node, the left node should be smaller than 
the parent node and the right node should be bigger. When sorted and 
balanced like this properly, it becomes very fast to find the value that
 you need. This is because if you need to find a value, you don&#8217;t need 
to traverse through every node to find a match like a linked list would.
 For example, if you wanted to find the value of 4 in the above tree, it
 would start at the top and see that 4 is less than 5. Since the left 
node is supposed to be less than the parent, it would then go to the 
left node and do the same thing. Now 4 is more than 3, so it would look 
to the right because the right node is larger than the parent. By 
following this logic, even very large trees (as long as it is balanced) 
will have very fast and scalable execution times for access, search, 
delete, and insert functions (O(log(n))).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the worst
 case scenario though, if the tree is completely unbalanced, it might 
just look like an ordered linked list. Below is an example visualization
 of an unbalanced tree:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">(1)<br>  \<br>  (2)<br>    \<br>    (3)<br>      \<br>      (4)</pre>



<p>In that case, finding the value 4 would take linear execution time, since it has to traverse through everything.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>If you have followed through the Ruby on Rails tutorials on this website, then you should have a basic working application with an API to create, read, update, or delete items from your database. Following these concepts, you can build a lot of different applications, since this is essentially what almost every web application does. For example, a website that allows you to see movie ratings and reviews (such as IMDB) follows the same concept: </p>



<ul><li>Has a database of objects, in this case it stores movies. </li><li>The movies have columns such as name, year, rating or summary. </li><li>There is something that pulls this information from the database and renders it for the public to see. </li></ul>



<p>Even
 things like Twitter or Airbnb build on these same concepts (they are 
definitely more complicated than this, but the point is that they are 
all just applications that interact with a database and render things to
 users). So if you just build upon this template application, you can 
make a lot of different inventions. However, when the projects get 
really big (maybe you end up storing a million books in the database), 
then the application will naturally take longer to process this. In 
these cases, you will want to make sure that your code is as optimal as 
you can make it so that the application can keep running fast and scale 
better with time. For example, if you are implementing a search 
function, you don&#8217;t want the code to go through a simple For Loop and 
loop through the millions of books before finding the resulting book. </p>



<p>The
 next few articles will also go through important concepts such as data 
structures and algorithms to help get a clearer picture of what 
efficient code looks like. However, it would be beneficial to first 
understand what Big O is to know how to evaluate the efficiency of code.
 This article will introduce you to some of the main points of the Big O
 notation so that you will have a basic understanding of what it is 
about. </p>



<h2>Big O</h2>



<p>Big O is a mathematical 
representation that describes how much time and space an algorithm 
requires as the input grows. We are going to go over 4 different run 
times that are most commonly seen: O(n), O(n^2), O(log n), and O(1). If 
you are afraid of math and feel like this makes no sense already, don&#8217;t 
worry. I will go over this in plain English and will give simple 
examples to illustrate what each of these mean. This also means that the
 explanations in this article will be very basic and will definitely not
 go into as much detail as an academic textbook would, so if you are 
interested in this area then I would recommend taking a longer course on
 this since it is a very significant area in computer science. That 
being said, I do believe that even having a basic understanding of this 
is very valuable and will help you improve the way you code. </p>



<h3>O(n)</h3>



<p>When
 people refer to something as having a run time of O(n), it means that 
it will take as long as the size of &#8220;n&#8221; (the variable). For example, the
 below code would be considered to have O(n) run time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n times. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>If you recall from the <a href="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/programming-basics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="If you recall from the Programming article, the for loop will run as long as the condition of &quot;i < n&quot; is true. This means that this function will run 5 times if the value of &quot;n&quot; is 5, and 5000 times if the value of &quot;n&quot; is 5000. This has a &quot;linear&quot; run time because the size of &quot;n&quot; is proportionate to how many times it will run at a 1:1 ratio. So in the Search function example above, if the function loops through a million Book entries in alphabetical order, users will have to wait for the function to run a million times before it reaches the end. In the best case (&quot;maybe the book being searched starts with &quot;A&quot;), it might only have to loop through a handful of times before returning the result. Similarly, in the worst case scenario (maybe a Book's name is &quot;ZZZZZZ&quot;), then it will run the whole million times before returning the result. Although this can be very fast if the book's name started with &quot;A&quot;, Big O generally refers to the worst case scenario as its run time. So a simple for loop in this case would be O(n).  (opens in a new tab)">Programming</a> article, the for loop will run as long as the condition of &#8220;i &lt; n&#8221; is true. This means that this function will run 5 times if the value of &#8220;n&#8221; is 5, and 5000 times if the value of &#8220;n&#8221; is 5000. This has a &#8220;linear&#8221; run time because the size of &#8220;n&#8221; is proportionate to how many times it will run at a 1:1 ratio. So in the Search function example above, if the function loops through a million Book entries in alphabetical order, users will have to wait for the function to run a million times before it reaches the end. In the best case (&#8220;maybe the book being searched starts with &#8220;A&#8221;), it might only have to loop through a handful of times before returning the result. Similarly, in the worst case scenario (maybe a Book&#8217;s name is &#8220;ZZZZZZ&#8221;), then it will run the whole million times before returning the result. Although this can be very fast if the book&#8217;s name started with &#8220;A&#8221;, Big O generally refers to the worst case scenario as its run time. So a simple for loop in this case would be O(n). </p>



<h3>O(n^2)</h3>



<p>This is O(n) to the power of 2, which means it runs exponentially slower than O(n). The code below would be considered O(n^2): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {<br>	for (j =0; j &lt; n; i++) {<br>	console.log("I will run n * n times. ");	<br>	}<br>}</pre>



<p>You can see that there is a for loop nested within a for loop, 
and both of them depend on the size of &#8220;n&#8221;. Which means that if n is 10,
 then both the &#8220;j&#8221; and &#8220;i&#8221; loops have to run 10 times each. Since the 
&#8220;j&#8221; loop is nested within the &#8220;i&#8221; loop, the &#8220;j&#8221; loop has to run 10 times
 before the &#8220;i&#8221; value increments by 1. To finish, &#8220;i&#8221; will also need to 
run 10 times, which means 10 times 10. The point here is that both loops
 depend on the same variable and one of the loops is nested in the 
other. This makes it take exponentially longer to run as the size of n 
increases. </p>



<h3>O(log n)</h3>



<p>This one might be a bit 
more complicated to understand in terms of the code. However, the 
concept is much easier to understand. Algorithms that have a O(log n) or
 logarithmic run time are often regarded as very efficient and scalable.
 The code below is regarded as O(log n): </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function divideByTwo(n) {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>   if (n == 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 1;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;} else if (n &gt; 1) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;var previousNumber = divideByTwo(n / 2);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;console.log(n);<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return n;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>}</pre>



<p>We haven&#8217;t went through &#8220;recursion&#8221; so the above code might 
look a bit confusing (recursion is essentially a function that calls 
itself). The code takes the input &#8220;n&#8221;, prints out the number, then 
divide it by 2, and print out that number, then divide by 2 and so on 
until the resulting number is less than 1. You can see that this is 
scalable because even if the input is a million, if you keep dividing it
 by 2, the number of times this function has to run is still less than 
30. The number of times this function has to run only increases by 1 
every time &#8220;n&#8221; doubles in size. </p>



<p>We implement these kind of 
functions in real life all the time. For example, when you open up a 
dictionary and want to find a word, you only need to flip through the 
dictionary a few times before you find your word even though it may have
 thousands of pages. If the word is &#8220;happy&#8221;, you might start by opening 
the dictionary from the middle. If you reach the &#8220;m&#8221; section, you 
automatically flip back (maybe halfway). If this next section starts 
with &#8220;e&#8221;, then you flip forward again and repeat until you reach the &#8220;h&#8221;
 section to find your word. No matter how big the dictionary is, it is 
always a doable task because you are able to halve your results with 
each flip. This is much more efficient than flipping through each page 
one at a time, similar to what a for loop would do. </p>



<h3>O(1)</h3>



<p>This
 one just means constant time. It doesn&#8217;t depend on any input size, the 
amount of time it runs is always going to be the same. A function like 
below would be considered constant time: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">function doBunchOfThings() {<br>	console.log("Do something. ");<br>	console.log("Do another thing. ");<br>	console.log("Do even more things. ");<br>	console.log("Keep doing things. ");<br>	console.log("Just do one more thing. ");<br>}</pre>



<p>No matter how many console.log() functions is fit in there, it 
is always going to be O(1) run time because there is no variable input. </p>



<p>There
 are a lot more notations out there and definitely more to analyzing run
 times, however, these are the essential concepts that should give you a
 decent understanding of how to determine the run time of a function. </p>



<p>For a chart of some different Big O notations and their run times, please see this link: <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://bigocheatsheet.com/</a></p>

<h3>Intro</h3>



<p>When your application has gone live, you will probably want some way of monitoring it. For example, it would be very helpful if you were able to see how many users are visiting your site, where they are visiting from, or if it is even still running at all. This article will go through some free tools that can help you accomplish just that. </p>



<h3>Google Analytics</h3>



<p>Google Analytics can help check how many visitors you get, which location (both geographic and links) they are coming from, and what time people tend tovisit. To get started, create an account here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank">https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/</a></p>



<p>The website has a lot of detailed guides on how to use it, but once you see the graphs it should be pretty self explanatory to find the basic information you need. To add Google Analytics to your site, you basically just need to add a JavaScript tag to your website. If you followed the Ruby on Rails tutorial on this site, this can be put in your views files found in /applicationfolder/app/views/. The application layout file is recommended since elements in that file should show up on every page. To get this code snippet, go to Admin &gt; create and account, then create a new property. Fill out the input boxes to generate your script. You can then find it in Admin under the property section under Tracking Info. </p>



<p>It can take 24 hours for it
 to start working. Please note that AdBlocker addons can prevent Google 
Analytics from tracking you (this also means other users using adblocker
 may not be tracked as well). If you are having issues with this, I 
would recommend download the Google Tag Assistant addon (or other Google
 Analytics addons) since it can help provide you more information on any
 errors your website may be having with the script. </p>



<h3>Uptime Robot</h3>



<p>A very simple free service that checks your website every once in a while to see if it is down. You can sign up at their website here: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://uptimerobot.com/" target="_blank">https://uptimerobot.com/</a> and follow their instructions to send you email notifications whenever a website is detected to be down. </p>



<h3>Nginx Amplify</h3>



<p>If
 you have setup your Nginx server in the previous articles, you can use 
this free tool to monitor your server. You can get information on how 
many visitors/connections you have, what kind of errors users are 
encountering, how often, and how much of your server&#8217;s resources are 
being used. It is a helpful tool to help you monitor the health of your 
server. You can sign up at their website here: <a href="https://amplify.nginx.com/login" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://amplify.nginx.com/login</a>
 and follow their instructions to set this up. It is very fast to setup 
and their instructions are very clear and straight-forward. Once you 
have set it up, you can log into their website to check the status of 
your application at your convenience</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>After you have made your website live and accessible by the world, you may want to  give the public a way to find your website. Search Engine Optimization  (SEO) is the practice of making a website more accessible through search  engines. This way when people use search engines like Google to search  for a topic related to your site, your website has a higher chance of  being in the user&#8217;s search results. This article will go through some of  the very basics of SEO that you should be aware of. </p>



<h2>Search Engines</h2>



<p>First,
 let&#8217;s briefly go over what search engines are and how they work. A 
search engine is an application designed to search the internet for 
content. Some examples of search engines would be Google, Yahoo, and 
Bing. When you type in a search term on their website, it searches 
through their index for relevant content and presents it to you. These 
indexes are typically built by using programs called web crawlers. Web 
crawlers are programs that go to websites and visit every link they can 
see from there, while saving all the content that they are able to save.
 This means that if no other website has a link to your website, is it 
unlikely that your website will get found by these crawlers and get 
indexed in the search engines. However, you can submit your URL to these
 services so that they can index it for you. </p>



<h2>SEO</h2>



<p>Some
 SEO methods can also change with time, since it depends on how each 
search engine currently ranks their search results. Sometimes things 
that worked a few years ago may not work as well in the present. For 
example, when search engines were still new you could probably show up 
at the top of the results if you were to spam other websites with links 
to your own website. This is because some search engines will rank 
websites higher in their results if they see a site being referenced 
more, since more references can imply that the website is more credible.
 As a result, some people may employ the use of bots to mass register on
 other people&#8217;s websites and post links to their own site, or even write
 about it in their user profiles to try and trick search engines. 
However, most search engines will change and improve their ranking 
system, so these methods may actually be detrimental to your site&#8217;s 
credibility if done in more recent years. So in the rest of this 
article, we will go through basic things that seem to have remained 
consistent with time. </p>



<h3>Submitting your website</h3>



<p>Most
 search engines will allow you to submit your website&#8217;s URL to them so 
they can start crawling. You can search up each of these search engine 
for instructions on oing so. For example, Google has this page that 
provides further instructions: 
https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/submit-url</p>



<h3>Title Tags</h3>



<p>Title tags determine what is displayed on search engines as the title. In the picture below, this would be the first line that you see in the Search result (the word &#8220;Google&#8221;). </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1191" srcset="https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1.png 583w, https://www.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/image-1-300x52.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 583px) 100vw, 583px" /></figure>



<p>A title tag goes in you &lt;head&gt; part of the HTML document and should something look like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;title&gt;Your Title&lt;/title&gt;
</pre>



<p>This is very important to have since it briefly describes what the page is about. </p>



<h3>Meta Tag Keywords</h3>



<p>You
 may still see this on some sites. This tag includes some keywords that 
are relevant to the page, but may not be used by some of the major 
search engines anymore. The meta tag to include keywords should look 
something like this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;meta name="keywords" content="great, tutorials, simple "&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Meta Tag Description</h3>



<p>The description tag 
briefly summarizes the page and what it is about (in more detail than 
the title). It is recommended to be less than 160 characters. In the 
picture above, this would be the third line. The meta tag to include a 
description should look something like this: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;meta name="description" content="Simple tutorials to give an idea what to expect. "&gt;
</pre>



<p>Including the above elements on your 
website will help search engines index your site better. Otherwise, they
 may not know what to display, or see that the site does not have much 
value and rank it very low. There are a lot of other methods you can use
 such as adding back links, reducing loading times, and optimizing 
keywords, but adding the tags above would be a good place to start. You 
can always search for the most relevant SEO tips of the year to get more
 up to date information on this topic. There are SEO tools that help 
automatically assess your website&#8217;s SEO while providing you with tips as
 well. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Once you have built a web application, you will have to set up and configure a server before it can be deployed in a production environment. However, before  diving into server configurations, learning how to use the terminal is  very important. </p>



<h2>Terminal</h2>



<p>The terminal is used to execute commands to your server. You can use it to move files, search for text, and install software. It can basically do anything that your normal graphical interface can. It also allows you to automate many things and can accomplish tasks faster as compared to using the graphical interface. </p>



<p>For example, in Windows Explorer, if you wanted to move all files with the letter S to another folder, you might have to find and drag the files multiple times if there are other files in there without the letter S. However, the command line can accomplish this with one line of code.</p>



<h2>Other resources<br></h2>



<p>This  article will go through all the most common commands that is used in  the terminal to help you get familiar with it. However, I would also  recommend doing a quick tutorial on this to grasp the basics here:  https://www.learnshell.org/</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>To access the terminal in Ubuntu, press CTRL + ALT + T.</p>



<h3>List files and folders</h3>



<p>Command: ls</p>



<p>List the contents of current folder</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ls
</pre>



<p>List the contents of a folder named test</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ls test
</pre>



<p>List the contents of a folder named test3 within another folder</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ls test/test2/test3
</pre>



<p>List all the contents in the current folder</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ls -a
</pre>



<p>List all the contents in a folder named test</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">ls -a test
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>The letter with a dash 
is called an argument. It lets the computer know to run the command with
 certain options enabled. Most commands will have the arguments, you can
 use the &#8220;man&#8221; command to bring up a manual with a list of Instructions 
on how to use commands. For example, &#8220;man ls&#8221;.</p>



<p>Some files and 
folders won&#8217;t be listed by ls without the -a argument. For example, 
folders that start with a &#8220;.&#8221; like the &#8220;.git&#8221; folder.</p>



<h3>Changing folders/directories</h3>



<p>Command: cd</p>



<p>Change to folder called test</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd test
</pre>



<p>Change to folder called test3 within multiple folders</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd test/test2/test3
</pre>



<p>Change to the folder in the previous level</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ..
</pre>



<p>Change to your home directory</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cd ~
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>When you are typing the
 name of a file or folder, you can press tab and it will autocomplete 
the name for you. For example, if you have these folder names in your 
current directory: test, sample, abc, abcdef, example</p>



<p>Then you can
 type &#8220;cd t&#8221; and then press tab and it will auto-complete to &#8220;cd test/&#8221;.
 You can also type cd &#8220;abcd&#8221; then tab to autocomplete to the abcdef 
folder. However, if you have two or more similar named files/folders, 
then you will have to keep typing until there is only one option. In 
that case, you can also press tab twice to see the different names of 
folders.</p>



<p>You can also type &#8220;pwd&#8221; to check your current directory.</p>



<h3>Moving, renaming, creating, removing and copying</h3>



<p>Command: mv, cp, touch, mkdir, rm</p>



<p>Move a file called test.txt to the folder test3</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mv test.txt test3/
</pre>



<p>Rename a file called test.txt to test3.txt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mv test.txt test3.txt
</pre>



<p>Move all files with the letter &#8220;s&#8221; to a folder called test3</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mv *s* test3
</pre>



<p>Copy a file called text3.txt to a file called text4.txt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">cp text3.txt text4.txt
</pre>



<p>Create a file called test5.txt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">touch test5.txt
</pre>



<p>Delete a file called test5.txt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rm test5.txt
</pre>



<p>Create a folder called test2</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">mkdir test2
</pre>



<p>Remove a folder called test2</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rmdir test2
</pre>



<p>Remove a directory called test2 that contains files/folders</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">rm -r test2
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Using the rm functions will remove the files from the system, it does not simply move them to the recycle bin.</p>



<h3>Output text and values</h3>



<p>Command: echo</p>



<p>Output the text &#8220;Hello World&#8221;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">echo "Hello World"
</pre>



<p>Output the current user</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">echo $USER
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>You can also set 
variables for your session by. You can type TESTVAR=&#8221;hi&#8221;, press enter 
then type echo $TESTVAR to see the result.</p>



<h3>Installing a program</h3>



<p>Command: apt</p>



<p>Install a program called curl that helps transfer data</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sudo apt install curl
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>sudo means to run the 
command with elevated privileges. Commands such as apt install that 
install software may require more permissions than a normal user.</p>



<p>apt
 is a package manager for Ubuntu (it is a program that helps install 
programs). In this case, we are telling apt to install a program called 
curl. Now that you have curl, you can use it to get website contents. 
Try typing &#8220;curl http://icanhazip.com&#8221; to get your ip address. You can 
also visit this website in your browser to see the results.</p>



<h3>Finding text within a file</h3>



<p>Command: grep</p>



<p>Find the word &#8220;hello&#8221; in a file called test.txt</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">grep "hello" test.txt
</pre>



<p>Find the world &#8220;hello&#8221; in a file called test.txt, but case insensitive</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">grep -i "hello" test.txt
</pre>



<p>Find the word &#8220;hello&#8221; in all the files within this folder and its subfolders, and also case insensitive</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">grep -ri "hello" *
</pre>



<p>These are some of the most common functions that you  will find yourself using when programming. As you install new programs,  you will also learn their commands. For example, Git and Rails will  have their own functions that you will eventually learn. When you want  to learn how to do something with the terminal, you can just Google  something like &#8220;how to write to file in Bash&#8221; or &#8220;how to manage  permissions with ubuntu terminal&#8221; (Bash is the scripting language that  we covered here).</p>



<h3>Script File<br></h3>



<p>Once you have found all the commands  that you want to do for a repetitive task, you can save all those  commands together in a file, and tell the the computer to run it as a  script. For example, if you wanted a script to automatically install  some programs, you can create a new text file called myScript.sh and put  the following inside:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">#!bin/bash
sudo apt install git
sudo apt install curl
echo "Finished installing!
</pre>



<p>Then save the file and run it by running this in the terminal</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">sh myScript.sh
</pre>



<p>That command should then run the commands from top 
to bottom. You can also  pass different arguments in the sh command for 
the script to use by adding text to the end. You can access each 
argument in order with $1, $2, $3, and so on. For example, if your file 
looked like</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">#!bin/bash
echo $1
echo $2
</pre>



<p>You can run &#8220;sh myScrip.sh myfirstarg mysecondarg&#8221; 
and watch it print out the arguments. Congratulations, you just created a
 script!</p>



<p><strong>Note: </strong></p>



<p>Windows also has
 a command line interface called Powershell or cmd. However, their 
commands are different and it doesn&#8217;t come with a package manager like 
Ubuntu does.</p>

<h2>Encrypting</h2>



<p>Encrypting
 is the process of turning data into something that is not 
understandable. Decrypting is the process of turning this jumbled 
information back into something readable. This is useful for hiding 
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and contact 
information. You can encrypt information in databases so that only 
authorized people will know how to decrypt it and view the information. </p>



<p>You can also encrypt data when it is transported through a network. For example, submitting payment information through an ecommerce website. We will go over this and how to encrypt your website like this in the later tutorials. <br></p>



<p>Two main types of encrypting information are Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric Encryption.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Symmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>In this method, the same key can encrypt and decrypt the information.&nbsp; <br></p>



<p>A very simplified illustration of encryption is below</p>



<p><strong>Message</strong>: </p>



<p>  I like apples</p>



<p><strong>Encryption Algorithm: </strong></p>



<p>Makes every letter increase by 1</p>



<p><strong>Encrypted Message: </strong></p>



<p>  j mjlf bqqmft</p>



<p>Send encrypted message</p>



<p>Receive encrypted message</p>



<p>Decrypt by moving every letter back by 1 to get message.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Asymmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In this method, there are two keys involved, 1 for encrypting the information (public key) and one for decrypting the information (private key).&nbsp;</p>



<p>A friendly introduction to asymmetric encryption can be found here: <br><a href="https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e">https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e</a><br></p>



<h2>Hashing</h2>



<p>Hashing
 also turns information into something not understandable. However, the 
algorithms are designed so that it is supposed to be impossible to 
decrypt back into something meaningful. This is a good way to hide 
information if there is need to decrypt the information. For example, 
some media sharing websites may have URLs that look like <a href="http://www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj</a>.
 That text at the end could be a hashed version of a very long title. In
 this case, visiting the URL with jumbled up text will lead to the 
correct video, so there is no need to decrypt it into something 
meaningful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption should be used when there is a need to read the original information. For example, sending emails with confidential information. People will need to be able to read this information, so a way to decrypt the message is necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hashing
 is more secure and should be used if it is not necessary to decrypt the
 information. For example, passwords usually do not need to be 
decrypted. When you create an account for most websites, the password 
you enter does not get stored in the database. The password is hashed, 
and then the resulting hash is stored in the database. So when you 
login, it is comparing the hashed value of what you entered with what is
 stored in the database. This is why &#8220;Forgot my password&#8221; functions do 
not send you your password, because they do not actually keep the 
password in a readable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The main points in this article are:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Encryption prevents unauthorized people from seeing information, and can be decrypted by authorized people to view the information.&nbsp;</li><li>Hashing will mess up information so that it cannot be decrypted into anything meaningful. </li></ul>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Web
 servers help your web application serve information to clients. You can
 run an application with Rails with just its default application server,
 but it will likely not do too well in a production environment with 
lots of users trying to use the application at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Servers</h2>



<p>There
 are three main web servers used for web applications today: Apache HTTP
 Server, Nginx, and IIS. Setting up servers like Nginx can also allow 
you to scale better when your application gets more users. For example, 
it can act as a load balancer that helps distribute traffic to different
 servers when one server becomes too overloaded with work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brief note on scaling:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There
 are two main types of scaling, scaling vertically and scaling 
horizontally. Scaling vertically in this context means adding more power
 to your machines (for example, more ram, cpu cores, etc). Scaling 
horizontally means adding more machine to help distribute the load. 
Scaling vertically can be very expensive at a certain point and may not 
yield as much performance/dollar when compared to horizontal scaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 servers can also help with configuring things such as SSL (the 
certificate that secures your website and gives it the HTTPS instead of 
HTTP in the URL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article outlines in more detail on the difference between servers:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/">https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/</a></p>


<p>I
 would also recommend reading more about load balancer and reverse 
proxies since these topics come up pretty often when configuring 
production environments. You likely will not need to know about these 
when starting off, but it is good to know that they exist:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/</a></p>


<p>We will go over how to use Nginx with Ruby On Rails in the other articles so that you know how to monitor your application. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways of storing and retrieving data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 applications typically use databases to manage their data. There are 2 
main types of databases: SQL based databases and NoSQL databases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SQL Databases</h2>



<p>SQL
 databases are relational databses. This means that an entry in a row 
can be related to another entry somewhere else in the database. For 
example, if you have a database that stores Books and Authors such as 
below:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Books</strong></p>

<p>Books
 with Ids 0 and 2 can be enforced to belong to the Author with an Id of 
0. SQL databases enforce this relationship so that if there is a 
conflict with these relationships, then it will let you know (in more 
cases, it won&#8217;t let oyu make the change or it will throw and error).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about SQL, this is a good interactive site for starting out:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">https://sqlbolt.com/</a></p>


<p>Examples of SQL relational databases: Postgresql, MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Databases can have tables. Tables can have Rows and Columns for storing information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211;
 SQL itself stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language that 
is used to query databases to retrieve and store information.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>



<p>NoSQL
 databases can also be queries with SQL. However, these databases do not
 enforce the relationships between the entries. So in theory, SQL 
dabases would be more stable, since it has these rules to keep the 
object relationships in check. However, having these rules enforced 
means more overhead in performance, so NoSQL databases will be faster in
 some areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more details on SQL vs NoSQL differences, see this article:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Examples of NoSQL databases: <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Couchbase</strong></p>



<h2>JSON</h2>



<p>JSON
 is another way to manage data. It is a data structure stored in text 
format that a lot of languages/tools are able to interpret. In web 
development, this is usually used to communicate data between servers. 
When requesting information from a server, the server can go into the 
data base to retrieve the data, then return the results to the requester
 in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A JSON object looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>{title: &#8220;Aligators&#8221;, Author: &#8220;Bob&#8221;};</p>



<p>For more information on JSON, refer to this article:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This
 article will go through some helpful tools that are used in web 
development. The tools/software in this section are what we will be 
using in this tutorial. </p>



<h3>Command Line</h3>



<p>We
 will be using the operating system Ubuntu 18.04 to create the project. 
You can open up the command line by pressing ctrl + alt + t. This is 
where you issue commands to the computer to do things. You can search 
online for interactive linux tutorials to learn more about using the 
command line. </p>



<h3>Virtual Machines</h3>



<p>Virtual
 machines can help you run the different operating systems if you do not
 want to buy a new machine or reformat your computer. It is also good to
 test out server related functions in an isolated environment later on 
in the tutorial. If something happens to go wrong and it breaks, your 
actual machine should still be fine and you can just create another 
virtual machine to start over. </p>



<p>These two virtual machines below are ones that I have used to develop on: </p>



<p>VMware: Pretty straightforward to use and the free version includes all the basic functions needed to start web development. </p>



<p>VirtualBox:
 The free version has the ability to create snapshots/backups of the 
state of the machine, incase anything were to go wrong. </p>



<h3>Browser developer tools</h3>



<p>For Chrome, you can access this by pressing F12 or going into &#8230; &gt; More Tools &gt; Developer Tools</p>



<p>The
 tabs you will likely use the most for troubleshooting will be Console 
and Network. The console tab shows errors or important messages when the
 page is loaded. You can also run JavaScript on it to interact with the 
page. The network tab can also show some errors and check responses from
 the server. </p>



<h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and text editors</h3>



<p>IDEs
 can help check the syntax for programming languages. They can also 
auto-complete certain keywords and generate commonly used functions. 
Most IDEs out there are very powerful and can help speed up the 
development process by a lot. However, in this tutorial we will be using
 normal text editors to build the program. Being too reliant on IDEs for
 checking errors or auto-generating code might build some bad habbits, 
so I tend to use text editors where possible. They are usually more 
light-weight so you can start programming on any old machine pretty 
fast. It&#8217;s also helpful to know how to use editors like Vim when editing
 on a server without a graphic interface. </p>



<p>Here are 
some good text editors to use (there are a lot of them out there, but 
these are the one&#8217;s I have used and liked so far): </p>



<p>&#8211; Sublime Text</p>



<p>&#8211; Atom</p>



<p>&#8211; Vim</p>



<p>&#8211; Nano</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Vim and Nano are text editors used in the command line. You can install it by typing in the terminal</p>



<p>sudo apt install vim</p>



<p>Then open up a new file by typing</p>



<p>vim yourfile.txt</p>



<p>Once
 you are in text editing mode, press esc, then a to start inserting 
words. If you want to quit without saving, press esc then type :q! and 
press enter. If you want to exit and save, press esc then type :wq</p>



<p>If
 you get trapped in Vim and can&#8217;t figure out how to exit, you can 
restart your machine and start with using Nano instead. The commands are
 right on the screen so it&#8217;s more straightforward for beginners. </p>



<h3>Version Control: Git</h3>



<p>You can install Git by typing in sudo apt install git</p>



<p>Git
 is a tool that helps keep track of changes you make to your code. It 
essentially helps you save drafts of your code, so that if you mess up, 
you can revert back to an old working version of the code. Before 
learning about Git, I used to copy my entire source code folder to make a
 backup, and name it something like code_backup_20180910 to keep track 
of the different version of my program. This can take a while and get 
pretty messy. With Git, whenever you get to a checkpoint in the project 
where you are happy with saving (maybe you finished a feature), you can 
just type git add . then git commit -m &#8220;Enter here a short description 
of the draft or changes that you made&#8221; then git push</p>



<p>Those three 
commands above will be the majority of commands that you will use in the
 beginning. After that, you will eventually learn how to put code into 
different branches and organize your progress/features for team 
development. I will leave it up to you to Google what each of those 
commands actually do. </p>



<h4>Other Tools<br></h4>



<p>Here are some other useful tools that you may want to look into: <br></p>



<p><strong>Fiddler </strong>is similar to the Network tab for the browser developer tools, but can show things in more detail. </p>



<p><strong>Postman </strong>helps test out RESTful functions. More on RESTful topics later. </p>



<p><strong>Jing </strong>is a great free program for capturing screenshots. Screenshots can help a lot when clarifying things over the internet. </p>



<p><strong>PGAdmin </strong>can help view Postgresql databases in a graphical interface. Most databases have a program that can help view things in a GUI. </p>



<p>You
 may not need the below tools for personal development, but most tech 
companies nowadays seem to use these so it is good to know they exist so
 you can read up on them: </p>



<p><strong>JIRA and Redmine </strong>&#8211;
 Helps keep track of tasks, bugs, and improvement requests. People can 
easily log bug reports or see what they need to do for the day. (Redmine
 is open source and free). </p>



<p><strong>Splunk </strong>&#8211; Indexes your
 data and provides search utilities for it. When indexing log files, it 
can help troubleshoot server issues. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>Jenkins and Travis C</strong>I
 &#8211; For continuous integration. Essentially makes sure your application 
passes its tests whenever someone pushes a changes. (Travis CI is free, 
Jenkins is free, but need your own server). </p>



<p><strong>Codecov </strong>&#8211; Helps keep track of how much of the code is covered by tests. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>BitBucket</strong> &#8211; Version control like Git, but allows for free private repositories. (Free)</p>

<p>Testing is an important part of programming that ensures code quality and makes life easier in the long run. </p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p>If
 you are a complete beginner and have next to zero programming 
knowledge, then this section might not make as much sense. It should 
make more sense after making a few small projects and understanding how 
coding works in general. We won&#8217;t actually go deep into testing in these
 series of articles, so you can skim through it if you want, but this is
 definitely an important topic to know about somewhere down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In
 this article, we will briefly discuss the importance of testing code. 
When writing code, it is good practice to write tests for the code as 
well. This way, if you make any changes to the application in the 
future, you can run the tests to see if they still work as intended 
without having to manually test every function again to see if they were
 affected. We will go through a few testing topics below just to get an 
understanding of it. </p>



<h2><strong>Unit Tests</strong></h2>



<p>Unit tests are essentially pieces of code that test other code. For example, if we have the below function in Java:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int x = 1;

int addYToX(int y)&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;return x + y;
}
</pre>



<p>A test for this function could look like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(3, result);
}
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; You can ignore the 
&#8220;public void&#8221; part for now if you are not familiar with it. The main 
point of the first function is to take a variable &#8216;y&#8217; and add it to x, 
which has an initial value of 1. The test below then tests it by giving 
the addYtoX a value of 2. The &#8220;assertEquals&#8221; function then checks to 
verify if adding 2 to x that the function will return 3.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Driven development (TDD)</strong></h3>



<p>This
 is a style of development that is very popular for companies today. TDD
 means that you are writing your tests first before writing the code. 
This makes it more likely for developers to cover more of their code 
with tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, writing tests can also help a person 
write better code. This is because, writing testable code usually 
involves breaking a function down into smaller/testable pieces, which 
prevents functions from getting too convoluted. Making functions 
simpler, more readable, and shorter is usually a good way to prevent 
headaches in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, writing tests also help 
you think about covering edge cases and how the functions should handle 
unexpected input. This can make the code more robust and less likely to 
error out with unusual inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3>



<p>Behaviour
 Driven Development just is a way to write or implement the tests. In 
the above example, we tested whether adding 2 to x will equal 3 if x 
starts at 1. This may work if x is always expect to be 1, but if x 
starts at 2, then we would have to rewrite the test to to check if 
adding 2 to x equals 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent the need of rewriting 
this, we can test the behaviour the function instead of hard-coding 
things in. In this case, the behaviour of the function &#8220;addYToX&#8221; is to 
add the variable y to the variable x, so we can specify that in the test
 instead:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(x + y, result);
}
</pre>



<p>This way instead of changing and specifying the 
expected result each time, the test is saying that the expected result 
should be x + y.&nbsp;</p>

 programming languages have a unit testing framework to help you get 
started with implementing tests for the project. You can learn more
