<h2>Encrypting</h2>



<p>Encrypting
 is the process of turning data into something that is not 
understandable. Decrypting is the process of turning this jumbled 
information back into something readable. This is useful for hiding 
sensitive information such as credit card numbers and contact 
information. You can encrypt information in databases so that only 
authorized people will know how to decrypt it and view the information. </p>



<p>You
 can also encrypt data that is being transported through a network (such
 as submitting payment information through an ecommerce website). On 
websites, data being transferred to the server is encrypted if you see 
https insteald of http in the URL. We will go over this and how to 
encrypt your website like this later on in the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When information is encrypted, there is usually a key that only authorized people know of that can decrypt this information. Two main types of encrypting information are Symmetric encryption and Asymmetric Encryption. </p>



<h3>Symmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p>&nbsp;In this method, the information being encrypted is encrypted and decrypted with the same key.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A very simplified illustration of encryption is below</p>



<p><strong>Message</strong>: </p>



<p>  I like apples</p>



<p><strong>Encryption Algorithm: </strong></p>



<p>Makes every letter increase by 1</p>



<p><strong>Encrypted Message: </strong></p>



<p>  j mjlf bqqmft</p>



<p>Send encrypted message</p>



<p>Receive encrypted message</p>



<p>Decrypt by moving every letter back by 1 to get message.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Asymmetric encryption:&nbsp;</h3>



<p> In this method, there are two keys involved, 1 for encrypting the information (public key) and one for decrypting the information (private key). </p>



<p>A friendly introduction to asymmetric encryption can be found here: <br><a href="https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e">https://hackernoon.com/asymmetric-encryption-explained-using-chocolate-boxes-5a329ea6813e</a><br></p>



<h2>Hashing</h2>



<p>Hashing
 also turns information into something not understandable. However, the 
algorithms are designed so that it is supposed to be impossible to 
decrypt back into something meaningful. This is a good way to hide 
information if there is need to decrypt the information. For example, 
some media sharing websites may have URLs that look like <a href="http://www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">www.website.com/video/3yKoHgjtyenCOIRayhdtyj</a>.
 That text at the end could be a hashed version of a very long title. In
 this case, visiting the URL with jumbled up text will lead to the 
correct video, so there is no need to decrypt it into something 
meaningful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Encryption should be used when you have a need to 
read the original information. For example, sending emails with 
confidential information. People will need to be able to read this 
information, so a way to decrypt the message is necessary.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hashing
 is more secure and should be used if it is not necessary to decrypt the
 information. For example, passwords usually do not need to be 
decrypted. When you create an account for most websites, the password 
you enter does not get stored in the database. The password is hashed, 
and then the resulting hash is stored in the database. So when you 
login, it is comparing the hashed value of what you entered with what is
 stored in the database. This is why &#8220;Forgot my password&#8221; functions do 
not send you your password, because they do not actually keep the 
password in a readable format.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The main points in this article are:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<ul><li>Encryption
 prevents unauthorized people from seeing information, and can be 
decrypted by authorized people to view the information.&nbsp;</li><li>Hashing messes up information so that it cannot be decrypted into anything meaningful. </li></ul>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>Web
 servers help your web application serve information to clients. You can
 run an application with Rails with just its default application server,
 but it will likely not do too well in a production environment with 
lots of users trying to use the application at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Servers</h2>



<p>There
 are three main web servers used for web applications today: Apache HTTP
 Server, Nginx, and IIS. Setting up servers like Nginx can also allow 
you to scale better when your application gets more users. For example, 
it can act as a load balancer that helps distribute traffic to different
 servers when one server becomes too overloaded with work.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Brief note on scaling:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There
 are two main types of scaling, scaling vertically and scaling 
horizontally. Scaling vertically in this context means adding more power
 to your machines (for example, more ram, cpu cores, etc). Scaling 
horizontally means adding more machine to help distribute the load. 
Scaling vertically can be very expensive at a certain point and may not 
yield as much performance/dollar when compared to horizontal scaling.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 servers can also help with configuring things such as SSL (the 
certificate that secures your website and gives it the HTTPS instead of 
HTTP in the URL).&nbsp;</p>



<p>This article outlines in more detail on the difference between servers:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/">https://lunarpages.com/apache-vs-iis-which-web-server-should-you-choose/</a></p>


<p>I
 would also recommend reading more about load balancer and reverse 
proxies since these topics come up pretty often when configuring 
production environments. You likely will not need to know about these 
when starting off, but it is good to know that they exist:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/">https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/reverse-proxy-server/</a></p>


<p>We will go over how to use Nginx with Ruby On Rails in the other articles so that you know how to monitor your application. </p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>In this article, we will go over some of the most common ways of storing and retrieving data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Web
 applications typically use databases to manage their data. There are 2 
main types of databases: SQL based databases and NoSQL databases.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>SQL Databases</h2>



<p>SQL
 databases are relational databses. This means that an entry in a row 
can be related to another entry somewhere else in the database. For 
example, if you have a database that stores Books and Authors such as 
below:&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Books</strong></p>



<p>_______________________<br>|___Id_|__Title___|_Author_|<br>|___0__|Aligators_|__Bob__|<br>|___1__|Squirrels_|__Joe__|<br>|___2__|Pumpkins|__Bob__|<br>|___3__|Eggplants|__Susie_|<br></p>



<p><strong>Authors</strong></p>



<p>_______________________<br>|__Id__|__Name__|_Age___|<br>|___0__|___Bob__|___23__|<br>|___1__|___Joe__|___27__|<br>|___2__|_Susie__|___29__|<br></p>



<p>Books
 with Ids 0 and 2 can be enforced to belong to the Author with an Id of 
0. SQL databases enforce this relationship so that if there is a 
conflict with these relationships, then it will let you know (in more 
cases, it won&#8217;t let oyu make the change or it will throw and error).&nbsp;</p>



<p>To learn more about SQL, this is a good interactive site for starting out:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://sqlbolt.com/">https://sqlbolt.com/</a></p>


<p>Examples of SQL relational databases: Postgresql, MySQL.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Notes:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; Databases can have tables. Tables can have Rows and Columns for storing information.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8211;
 SQL itself stands for Structured Query Language. It is a language that 
is used to query databases to retrieve and store information.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>NoSQL Databases</h2>



<p>NoSQL
 databases can also be queries with SQL. However, these databases do not
 enforce the relationships between the entries. So in theory, SQL 
dabases would be more stable, since it has these rules to keep the 
object relationships in check. However, having these rules enforced 
means more overhead in performance, so NoSQL databases will be faster in
 some areas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For more details on SQL vs NoSQL differences, see this article:&nbsp;</p>


<p><a href="https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool">https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool</a></p>


<p>Examples of NoSQL databases: <strong>MongoDB</strong>, <strong>Couchbase</strong></p>



<h2>JSON</h2>



<p>JSON
 is another way to manage data. It is a data structure stored in text 
format that a lot of languages/tools are able to interpret. In web 
development, this is usually used to communicate data between servers. 
When requesting information from a server, the server can go into the 
data base to retrieve the data, then return the results to the requester
 in JSON format.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A JSON object looks like this:&nbsp;</p>



<p>{title: &#8220;Aligators&#8221;, Author: &#8220;Bob&#8221;};</p>



<p>For more information on JSON, refer to this article:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This
 article will go through some helpful tools that are used in web 
development. The tools/software in this section are what we will be 
using in this tutorial. </p>



<h3>Command Line</h3>



<p>We
 will be using the operating system Ubuntu 18.04 to create the project. 
You can open up the command line by pressing ctrl + alt + t. This is 
where you issue commands to the computer to do things. You can search 
online for interactive linux tutorials to learn more about using the 
command line. </p>



<h3>Virtual Machines</h3>



<p>Virtual
 machines can help you run the different operating systems if you do not
 want to buy a new machine or reformat your computer. It is also good to
 test out server related functions in an isolated environment later on 
in the tutorial. If something happens to go wrong and it breaks, your 
actual machine should still be fine and you can just create another 
virtual machine to start over. </p>



<p>These two virtual machines below are ones that I have used to develop on: </p>



<p>VMware: Pretty straightforward to use and the free version includes all the basic functions needed to start web development. </p>



<p>VirtualBox:
 The free version has the ability to create snapshots/backups of the 
state of the machine, incase anything were to go wrong. </p>



<h3>Browser developer tools</h3>



<p>For Chrome, you can access this by pressing F12 or going into &#8230; &gt; More Tools &gt; Developer Tools</p>



<p>The
 tabs you will likely use the most for troubleshooting will be Console 
and Network. The console tab shows errors or important messages when the
 page is loaded. You can also run JavaScript on it to interact with the 
page. The network tab can also show some errors and check responses from
 the server. </p>



<h3>Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and text editors</h3>



<p>IDEs
 can help check the syntax for programming languages. They can also 
auto-complete certain keywords and generate commonly used functions. 
Most IDEs out there are very powerful and can help speed up the 
development process by a lot. However, in this tutorial we will be using
 normal text editors to build the program. Being too reliant on IDEs for
 checking errors or auto-generating code might build some bad habbits, 
so I tend to use text editors where possible. They are usually more 
light-weight so you can start programming on any old machine pretty 
fast. It&#8217;s also helpful to know how to use editors like Vim when editing
 on a server without a graphic interface. </p>



<p>Here are 
some good text editors to use (there are a lot of them out there, but 
these are the one&#8217;s I have used and liked so far): </p>



<p>&#8211; Sublime Text</p>



<p>&#8211; Atom</p>



<p>&#8211; Vim</p>



<p>&#8211; Nano</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>



<p>Vim and Nano are text editors used in the command line. You can install it by typing in the terminal</p>



<p>sudo apt install vim</p>



<p>Then open up a new file by typing</p>



<p>vim yourfile.txt</p>



<p>Once
 you are in text editing mode, press esc, then a to start inserting 
words. If you want to quit without saving, press esc then type :q! and 
press enter. If you want to exit and save, press esc then type :wq</p>



<p>If
 you get trapped in Vim and can&#8217;t figure out how to exit, you can 
restart your machine and start with using Nano instead. The commands are
 right on the screen so it&#8217;s more straightforward for beginners. </p>



<h3>Version Control: Git</h3>



<p>You can install Git by typing in sudo apt install git</p>



<p>Git
 is a tool that helps keep track of changes you make to your code. It 
essentially helps you save drafts of your code, so that if you mess up, 
you can revert back to an old working version of the code. Before 
learning about Git, I used to copy my entire source code folder to make a
 backup, and name it something like code_backup_20180910 to keep track 
of the different version of my program. This can take a while and get 
pretty messy. With Git, whenever you get to a checkpoint in the project 
where you are happy with saving (maybe you finished a feature), you can 
just type git add . then git commit -m &#8220;Enter here a short description 
of the draft or changes that you made&#8221; then git push</p>



<p>Those three 
commands above will be the majority of commands that you will use in the
 beginning. After that, you will eventually learn how to put code into 
different branches and organize your progress/features for team 
development. I will leave it up to you to Google what each of those 
commands actually do. </p>



<p>Other useful tools that you may want to look into: </p>



<p>Fiddler is similar to the Network tab for the browser developer tools, but can show things in more detail. </p>



<p>Postman helps test out RESTful functions. More on RESTful topics later. </p>



<p>Jing is a great free program for capturing screenshots. Screenshots can help a lot when clarifying things over the internet. </p>



<p>PGAdmin
 can help view Postgresql databases in a graphical interface. Most 
databases have a program that can help view things in a GUI. </p>



<p>You
 may not need the below tools for personal development, but most tech 
companies nowadays seem to use these so it is good to know they exist so
 you can read up on them: </p>



<p><strong>JIRA and Redmine </strong>&#8211;
 Helps keep track of tasks, bugs, and improvement requests. People can 
easily log bug reports or see what they need to do for the day. (Redmine
 is open source and free). </p>



<p><strong>Splunk </strong>&#8211; Indexes your
 data and provides search utilities for it. When indexing log files, it 
can help troubleshoot server issues. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>Jenkins and Travis C</strong>I
 &#8211; For continuous integration. Essentially makes sure your application 
passes its tests whenever someone pushes a changes. (Travis CI is free, 
Jenkins is free, but need your own server). </p>



<p><strong>Codecov </strong>&#8211; Helps keep track of how much of the code is covered by tests. (Free)</p>



<p><strong>BitBucket</strong> &#8211; Version control like Git, but allows for free private repositories. (Free)</p>

<p>Testing is an important part of programming that ensures code quality and makes life easier in the long run. </p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p>If
 you are a complete beginner and have next to zero programming 
knowledge, then this section might not make as much sense. It should 
make more sense after making a few small projects and understanding how 
coding works in general. We won&#8217;t actually go deep into testing in these
 series of articles, so you can skim through it if you want, but this is
 definitely an important topic to know about somewhere down the line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In
 this article, we will briefly discuss the importance of testing code. 
When writing code, it is good practice to write tests for the code as 
well. This way, if you make any changes to the application in the 
future, you can run the tests to see if they still work as intended 
without having to manually test every function again to see if they were
 affected. We will go through a few testing topics below just to get an 
understanding of it. </p>



<h2><strong>Unit Tests</strong></h2>



<p>Unit tests are essentially pieces of code that test other code. For example, if we have the below function in Java:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">int x = 1;

int addYToX(int y)&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;return x + y;
}
</pre>



<p>A test for this function could look like this:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(3, result);
}
</pre>



<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>&#8211; You can ignore the 
&#8220;public void&#8221; part for now if you are not familiar with it. The main 
point of the first function is to take a variable &#8216;y&#8217; and add it to x, 
which has an initial value of 1. The test below then tests it by giving 
the addYtoX a value of 2. The &#8220;assertEquals&#8221; function then checks to 
verify if adding 2 to x that the function will return 3.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Test Driven development (TDD)</strong></h3>



<p>This
 is a style of development that is very popular for companies today. TDD
 means that you are writing your tests first before writing the code. 
This makes it more likely for developers to cover more of their code 
with tests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In some cases, writing tests can also help a person 
write better code. This is because, writing testable code usually 
involves breaking a function down into smaller/testable pieces, which 
prevents functions from getting too convoluted. Making functions 
simpler, more readable, and shorter is usually a good way to prevent 
headaches in the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, writing tests also help 
you think about covering edge cases and how the functions should handle 
unexpected input. This can make the code more robust and less likely to 
error out with unusual inputs.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)</strong></h3>



<p>Behaviour
 Driven Development just is a way to write or implement the tests. In 
the above example, we tested whether adding 2 to x will equal 3 if x 
starts at 1. This may work if x is always expect to be 1, but if x 
starts at 2, then we would have to rewrite the test to to check if 
adding 2 to x equals 4.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To help prevent the need of rewriting 
this, we can test the behaviour the function instead of hard-coding 
things in. In this case, the behaviour of the function &#8220;addYToX&#8221; is to 
add the variable y to the variable x, so we can specify that in the test
 instead:&nbsp;</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">public void testAddYToX()&nbsp;
{
&nbsp;&nbsp;int result = addYToX(2);
&nbsp;&nbsp;assertEquals(x + y, result);
}
</pre>



<p>This way instead of changing and specifying the 
expected result each time, the test is saying that the expected result

<h2>Intro</h2>



<p>This article will briefly review through some of the main features of programming that almost all programming languages require. These features make it possible for programs to implement their logic.</p>



<h2>Data Types</h2>



<p>In programming, there are 3 main data types that you will run into (there are a lot more depending on languages, but these should get the point across): </p>



<ul><li>Integers: These are non-decimal numbers (decimals are called Floats). Below, we will define a valid integer in JavaScript. 
var x = 1;</li><li>Strings: These are essentially text. Example for declaring a valid string: <br>
var x = &#8220;This Needs 2 Be Surrounded By Quotes To Be A String!&#8221;;</li><li>Booleans: These are data types that represent true or false: <br>
var x = false; </li></ul>



<p>It is important to know that in JavaScript, you can define almost any of these &#8216;primitive&#8217; data types with the &#8216;var&#8217; keyword. Different programming languages may require different keywords. For example, declaring an integer in Java would look like int x = 1;  </p>



<h2>If Statements</h2>



<ul><li>&#8220;If statements&#8221; help a program detect conditions and perform actions based on the conditions. For example, a self driving car may want the following logic: IF light is GREEN, press gas. If light is RED, stop. </li><li>In the following example, we make a program says &#8220;Go&#8221; if the variable x is Green and &#8220;Stop&#8221; if the variable is Red: </li><li></li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var x = "Green";<br>if (x == "Green")<br>{<br>console.log("Go");<br>}<br>else if (x == "Red")<br>{<br>console.log("Stop");<br>}</pre>



<p>The double equals sign in the parenthesis just means equals, so if (x == &#8220;Green&#8221;) means &#8220;if the variable x equals the text of Green. &#8220;</p>



<p>!= would mean &#8216;does not equal&#8217;. These are called comparators and you can find a list of them here for more details: </p>



<p>Different languages may also have different ways of comparing. For example, in Java, the same statement above would be if (x.equals(&#8220;Green&#8221;)). </p>



<p>If you are using Google Chrome, you can try running this code in your browser by opening the browser&#8217;s developer tools and typing this into the console. </p>



<p>Developer tools can be access by pressing the … button at the top &gt; More Tools &gt; Developer Tools &gt; Click on the tab that says Console.</p>



<p>You can change the x variable to &#8220;Red&#8221; and re-run the code to see what it outputs. </p>



<p>Note:</p>



<p>You may have noticed the squiggly brackets {}. These brackets are used to wrap the code that lets the program know what to do under that if condition. Some people may prefer this format where the brackets are on new lines, however, other people may prefer this format: </p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var x = "Green";<br>
if (x == "Green") {<br>
  console.log("Go");<br>
} <br>
else if (x == "Red") {<br>
  console.log("Stop");<br>
}</pre>



<p>These are both valid syntax, and as long as the brackets are there to wrap up the code, the way it&#8217;s styled is just preference. If you choose a bracket/indenting style for a project, the important thing is to be consistent with it. </p>



<p>Also, be aware that some languages such as Python might take indentation into consideration for valid code, so if you are following other tutorials for different languages, it is recommended to follow their syntax for the project to avoid headaches. </p>



<h2>Loops</h2>



<p>There are two main types of loops, the For loop and the While loop.</p>



<h3>For Loop</h3>



<p>The For loop looks like this:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">for (i=0; i &lt; 3; i++) {<br>
    console.log("Walked staircase number " + i);<br>
}<br>
console.log("Successfully walked 3 levels. ");</pre>



<p>The part that says &#8220;i=0; i &lt; 3; i++&#8221; basically means:</p>



<ol><li>(i=0) Declare the variable &#8220;i&#8221; and that it has a value of 0.</li><li>(i &lt; 3) Continue doing the actions below as long as &#8220;i&#8221; is less than 3.</li><li>(i++) After finishing the actions in the loop, add 1 to the variable &#8220;i&#8221;.</li></ol>



<p>The console.log between the curly braces is the loop. In this case, the program will write &#8220;Walked staircase number i&#8221; 3 time before printing out &#8220;Successfully walked 3 levels. &#8220;</p>



<p>If you run the above code (you can run in it your browser console to see), then the output would be:</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">Walked staircase number 0<br>Walked staircase number 1<br>Walked staircase number 2<br>Walked staircase number 3<br>Successfully walked 3 levels. <br></pre>



<p>This type of loop will usually be used if you know how many times you want to run a certain function(s) before moving on with the next steps.</p>



<h3>While Loop</h3>



<p>The While loop looks like this (don&#8217;t run this in your browser since it will run forever):</p>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">var button = "on";<br>
while (button == "on") {<br>
    console.log("The button is on. ");<br>
}</pre>



<p>This is basically saying to print out &#8220;The button is on. &#8221; while a variable called &#8220;button&#8221; has the value of &#8220;on&#8221;. The functions in here can run forever as long as the button variable does not change. in a real program, there would be a way for this variable to change. For example, there could be a function that sets the button&#8217;s value to be &#8220;off&#8221; when someone clicks on a part of the screen. </p>

<p>This article is a crash course on some of the basics regarding the internet and how it works. <br></p>



<h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">It&#8217;s important to understand that the internet is just a bunch of computers and devices connected to each other with wires. Each of these devices is assigned a unique identifier called an IP address. This address is essentially the address that lets other computers/devices know where to find them. </p>



<h2><strong>DNS</strong></h2>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">When an internet browser (such as Google Chrome) retrieves a web page for viewing, this is the general process that happens in most modern websites: </p>



<ol><li>Type in yourwebsite.com into browser and press Enter. </li><li>The browser (or client) goes to a Domain Name Server (DNS) to ask where yourwebsite.com resides. </li><li>The DNS looks through its records and finds that yourwebsite.com should go to a computer with an IP address of 12.123.12.12</li><li>The client then tries to connect to this IP address to retrieve content. </li></ol>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">The IP Address in this case usually leads to a server that is able to direct the client&#8217;s request to the correct areas. It can be the actual server that hosts the website content, or it could be a &#8220;load balancer&#8221;, which is a server that directs the user to another server that can provide the content (This is usually done so that one server doesn&#8217;t have to handle all the request and get burned out).</p>



<p class="has-medium-font-size">Below is a diagram illustrating this: </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://localhost/wp-content/uploads/lb.png" alt="" class="wp-image-96" srcset="https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/lb.png 603w, https://dev.mediocreinventions.com/wp-content/uploads/lb-300x229.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 603px) 100vw, 603px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Rendering</strong></h2>



<p class="has-normal-font-size">After the content is retrieved and is available for viewing, the internet browser will render this content to be human readable. There are 3 main elements to this that help render content: </p>



<ul><li>HTML: This is the markup language that tells the browser how to structure the content. For example, the below will ask the browser to render a paragraph that says &#8220;Hello World&#8221;:</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;</pre>



<ul><li>CSS: This is a stylesheet that describes how the page should be styled. For example, the below will ask the browser to make all paragraphs (text inside the  tags) red:</li></ul>



<pre class="wp-block-preformatted">p { color: red; }</pre>



<ul><li>JavaScript: This is the code that makes some of the elements on the page more interactive. For example, it can tell the browser to change the font color when the page is clicked (JavaScript can be used to accomplish a lot more for modern websites, but handling how elements behave is the main take-away point in this article). </li></ul>
