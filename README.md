# Mediocre Inventions

The is a website create to documenting my experiments with different combinations of technology stacks. This is created with WordPress and converted into a static website for better performance. This site can be visited at [https://www.mediocreinventions.com](https://www.mediocreinventions.com). </br> </br>
The tutorials are step-by-step articles so that anyone can follow through and re-create the projects that I have made. So far I have covered a few topics about Ruby on Rails, React, and web application hosting options. Hosting topics include AWS, Heroku, Nginx and Apache. There are also tutorials for setting up WordPress websites and articles that walk through web application basics. Links to these tutorial series can be found on the menu at the top of the page.
